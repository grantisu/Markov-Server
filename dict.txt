ABDICATION, n.  An act whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the high temperature of the throne.
ABDOMEN, n.  The temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with sacrificial rights, all true men engage.  From women this ancient faith commands but a stammering assent.  They sometimes minister at the altar in a half-hearted and ineffective way, but true reverence for the one deity that men really adore they know not.  If woman had a free hand in the world's marketing the race would become graminivorous.
ABILITY, n.  The natural equipment to accomplish some small part of the meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead ones.  In the last analysis ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high degree of solemnity.  Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is rightly appraised; it is no easy task to be solemn.
ABNORMAL, adj.  Not conforming to standard.  In matters of thought and conduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to be detested.  Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the straiter [sic] resemblance of the Average Man than he hath to himself. Whoso attaineth thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death and the hope of Hell.

ABSENTEE, n.  A person with an income who has had the forethought to remove himself from the sphere of exaction.
ABSOLUTE, adj.  Independent, irresponsible.  An absolute monarchy is one in which the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he pleases the assassins.  Not many absolute monarchies are left, most of them having been replaced by limited monarchies, where the sovereign's power for evil (and for good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, which are governed by chance.
ABSTAINER, n.  A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure.  A total abstainer is one who abstains from everything but abstention, and especially from inactivity in the affairs of others.

ALLIGATOR, n.  The crocodile of America, superior in every detail to the crocodile of the effete monarchies of the Old World.  Herodotus says the Indus is, with one exception, the only river that produces crocodiles, but they appear to have gone West and grown up with the other rivers.  From the notches on his back the alligator is called a sawrian.
ALONE, adj.  In bad company.
ALTAR, n.  The place whereupon the priest formerly raveled out the small intestine of the sacrificial victim for purposes of divination and cooked its flesh for the gods.  The word is now seldom used, except with reference to the sacrifice of their liberty and peace by a male and a female tool.

ASS, n.  A public singer with a good voice but no ear.  In Virginia City, Nevada, he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator, and everywhere the Donkey.  The animal is widely and variously celebrated in the literature, art and religion of every age and country; no other so engages and fires the human imagination as this noble vertebrate.  Indeed, it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, _lib. II., De Clem._, and C. Stantatus, _De Temperamente_) if it is not a god; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we may believe Macrobious, by the Cupasians also.  Of the only two animals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of men, the ass that carried Balaam is one, the dog of the Seven Sleepers the other.  This is no small distinction.  From what has been written about this beast might be compiled a library of great splendor and magnitude, rivalling that of the Shakespearean cult, and that which clusters about the Bible.  It may be said, generally, that all literature is more or less Asinine.
AUCTIONEER, n.  The man who proclaims with a hammer that he has picked a pocket with his tongue.
AUSTRALIA, n.  A country lying in the South Sea, whose industrial and commercial development has been unspeakably retarded by an unfortunate dispute among geographers as to whether it is a continent or an island.
AVERNUS, n.  The lake by which the ancients entered the infernal regions.  The fact that access to the infernal regions was obtained by a lake is believed by the learned Marcus Ansello Scrutator to have suggested the Christian rite of baptism by immersion.  This, however, has been shown by Lactantius to be an error.
BAAL, n.  An old deity formerly much worshiped under various names. As Baal he was popular with the Phoenicians; as Belus or Bel he had the honor to be served by the priest Berosus, who wrote the famous account of the Deluge; as Babel he had a tower partly erected to his glory on the Plain of Shinar.  From Babel comes our English word "babble."  Under whatever name worshiped, Baal is the Sun-god.  As Beelzebub he is the god of flies, which are begotten of the sun's rays on the stagnant water.  In Physicia Baal is still worshiped as Bolus, and as Belly he is adored and served with abundant sacrifice by the priests of Guttledom.
BABE or BABY, n.  A misshapen creature of no particular age, sex, or condition, chiefly remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and antipathies it excites in others, itself without sentiment or emotion. There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose adventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being preserved on a floating lotus leaf.
BACCHUS, n.  A convenient deity invented by the ancients as an excuse for getting drunk.
BACK, n.  That part of your friend which it is your privilege to contemplate in your adversity.

BARRACK, n.  A house in which soldiers enjoy a portion of that of which it is their business to deprive others.
BASILISK, n.  The cockatrice.  A sort of serpent hatched form the egg of a cock.  The basilisk had a bad eye, and its glance was fatal. Many infidels deny this creature's existence, but Semprello Aurator saw and handled one that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment for having fatally gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved.  Juno afterward restored the reptile's sight and hid it in a cave.  Nothing is so well attested by the ancients as the existence of the basilisk, but the cocks have stopped laying.
BASTINADO, n.  The act of walking on wood without exertion.
BATH, n.  A kind of mystic ceremony substituted for religious worship, with what spiritual efficacy has not been determined.

BEGGAR, n.  One who has relied on the assistance of his friends.

BELLADONNA, n.  In Italian a beautiful lady; in English a deadly poison.  A striking example of the essential identity of the two tongues.
BENEDICTINES, n.  An order of monks otherwise known as black friars.

BILLINGSGATE, n.  The invective of an opponent.
BIRTH, n.  The first and direst of all disasters.  As to the nature of it there appears to be no uniformity.  Castor and Pollux were born from the egg.  Pallas came out of a skull.  Galatea was once a block of stone.  Peresilis, who wrote in the tenth century, avers that he grew up out of the ground where a priest had spilled holy water.  It is known that Arimaxus was derived from a hole in the earth, made by a stroke of lightning.  Leucomedon was the son of a cavern in Mount Aetna, and I have myself seen a man come out of a wine cellar.
BLACKGUARD, n.  A man whose qualities, prepared for display like a box of berries in a market—the fine ones on top—have been opened on the wrong side.  An inverted gentleman.
BLANK-VERSE, n.  Unrhymed iambic pentameters—the most difficult kind of English verse to write acceptably; a kind, therefore, much affected by those who cannot acceptably write any kind.
BODY-SNATCHER, n.  A robber of grave-worms.  One who supplies the young physicians with that with which the old physicians have supplied the undertaker.  The hyena.
BONDSMAN, n.  A fool who, having property of his own, undertakes to become responsible for that entrusted to another to a third.
BORE, n.  A person who talks when you wish him to listen.

BOUNDARY, n.  In political geography, an imaginary line between two nations, separating the imaginary rights of one from the imaginary rights of the other.
BOUNTY, n.  The liberality of one who has much, in permitting one who has nothing to get all that he can.
BRAHMA, n.  He who created the Hindoos, who are preserved by Vishnu and destroyed by Siva—a rather neater division of labor than is found among the deities of some other nations.  The Abracadabranese, for example, are created by Sin, maintained by Theft and destroyed by Folly.  The priests of Brahma, like those of Abracadabranese, are holy and learned men who are never naughty.
BRAIN, n. An apparatus with which we think what we think.  That which distinguishes the man who is content to _be_ something from the man who wishes to _do_ something.  A man of great wealth, or one who has been pitchforked into high station, has commonly such a headful of brain that his neighbors cannot keep their hats on.  In our civilization, and under our republican form of government, brain is so highly honored that it is rewarded by exemption from the cares of office.
BRANDY, n.  A cordial composed of one part thunder-and-lightning, one part remorse, two parts bloody murder, one part death-hell-and-the grave and four parts clarified Satan.  Dose, a headful all the time. Brandy is said by Dr. Johnson to be the drink of heroes.  Only a hero will venture to drink it.
BRIDE, n.  A woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her.
BRUTE, n.  See HUSBAND.

CALUMNUS, n.  A graduate of the School for Scandal.

CARMELITE, n.  A mendicant friar of the order of Mount Carmel.
CARNIVOROUS, adj.  Addicted to the cruelty of devouring the timorous vegetarian, his heirs and assigns.
CARTESIAN, adj.  Relating to Descartes, a famous philosopher, author of the celebrated dictum, _Cogito ergo sum_—whereby he was pleased to suppose he demonstrated the reality of human existence.  The dictum might be improved, however, thus:  _Cogito cogito ergo cogito sum_— "I think that I think, therefore I think that I am;" as close an approach to certainty as any philosopher has yet made.
CAT, n.  A soft, indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle.
CAVILER, n.  A critic of our own work.
CEMETERY, n.  An isolated suburban spot where mourners match lies, poets write at a target and stone-cutters spell for a wager.  The inscriptions following will serve to illustrate the success attained in these Olympian games:
CENTAUR, n.  One of a race of persons who lived before the division of labor had been carried to such a pitch of differentiation, and who followed the primitive economic maxim, "Every man his own horse."  The best of the lot was Chiron, who to the wisdom and virtues of the horse added the fleetness of man.  The scripture story of the head of John the Baptist on a charger shows that pagan myths have somewhat sophisticated sacred history.
CERBERUS, n.  The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard the entrance—against whom or what does not clearly appear; everybody, sooner or later, had to go there, and nobody wanted to carry off the entrance.  Cerberus is known to have had three heads, and some of the poets have credited him with as many as a hundred.  Professor Graybill, whose clerky erudition and profound knowledge of Greek give his opinion great weight, has averaged all the estimates, and makes the number twenty-seven—a judgment that would be entirely conclusive is Professor Graybill had known (a) something about dogs, and (b) something about arithmetic.
CHILDHOOD, n.  The period of human life intermediate between the idiocy of infancy and the folly of youth—two removes from the sin of manhood and three from the remorse of age.
CHRISTIAN, n.  One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.

CLERGYMAN, n.  A man who undertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of bettering his temporal ones.
CLIO, n.  One of the nine Muses.  Clio's function was to preside over history—which she did with great dignity, many of the prominent citizens of Athens occupying seats on the platform, the meetings being addressed by Messrs. Xenophon, Herodotus and other popular speakers.
CLOCK, n.  A machine of great moral value to man, allaying his concern for the future by reminding him what a lot of time remains to him.

CRITIC, n.  A person who boasts himself hard to please because nobody tries to please him.
CROSS, n.  An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its significance to the most solemn event in the history of Christianity, but really antedating it by thousands of years.  By many it has been believed to be identical with the _crux ansata_ of the ancient phallic worship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, to the rites of primitive peoples.  We have to-day the White Cross as a symbol of chastity, and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent neutrality in war.  Having in mind the former, the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape smites the lyre to the effect following:
CUNNING, n.  The faculty that distinguishes a weak animal or person from a strong one.  It brings its possessor much mental satisfaction and great material adversity.  An Italian proverb says:  "The furrier gets the skins of more foxes than asses."
CUPID, n.  The so-called god of love.  This bastard creation of a barbarous fancy was no doubt inflicted upon mythology for the sins of its deities.  Of all unbeautiful and inappropriate conceptions this is the most reasonless and offensive.  The notion of symbolizing sexual love by a semisexless babe, and comparing the pains of passion to the wounds of an arrow—of introducing this pudgy homunculus into art grossly to materialize the subtle spirit and suggestion of the work— this is eminently worthy of the age that, giving it birth, laid it on the doorstep of prosperity.
CURIOSITY, n.  An objectionable quality of the female mind.  The desire to know whether or not a woman is cursed with curiosity is one of the most active and insatiable passions of the masculine soul.
CURSE, v.t.  Energetically to belabor with a verbal slap-stick.  This is an operation which in literature, particularly in the drama, is commonly fatal to the victim.  Nevertheless, the liability to a cursing is a risk that cuts but a small figure in fixing the rates of life insurance.
CYNIC, n.  A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be.  Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.
DAMN, v.  A word formerly much used by the Paphlagonians, the meaning of which is lost.  By the learned Dr. Dolabelly Gak it is believed to have been a term of satisfaction, implying the highest possible degree of mental tranquillity.  Professor Groke, on the contrary, thinks it expressed an emotion of tumultuous delight, because it so frequently occurs in combination with the word _jod_ or _god_, meaning "joy."  It would be with great diffidence that I should advance an opinion conflicting with that of either of these formidable authorities.
DANCE, v.i.  To leap about to the sound of tittering music, preferably with arms about your neighbor's wife or daughter.  There are many kinds of dances, but all those requiring the participation of the two sexes have two characteristics in common:  they are conspicuously innocent, and warmly loved by the vicious.
DARING, n.  One of the most conspicuous qualities of a man in security.
DATARY, n.  A high ecclesiastic official of the Roman Catholic Church, whose important function is to brand the Pope's bulls with the words _Datum Romae_.  He enjoys a princely revenue and the friendship of God.
DAWN, n.  The time when men of reason go to bed.  Certain old men prefer to rise at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach, and otherwise mortifying the flesh.  They then point with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of them.  The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all the others who have tried it.
DAY, n.  A period of twenty-four hours, mostly misspent.  This period is divided into two parts, the day proper and the night, or day improper—the former devoted to sins of business, the latter consecrated to the other sort.  These two kinds of social activity overlap.

DEBT, n.  An ingenious substitute for the chain and whip of the slave-driver.
DECALOGUE, n.  A series of commandments, ten in number—just enough to permit an intelligent selection for observance, but not enough to embarrass the choice.  Following is the revised edition of the Decalogue, calculated for this meridian.
DECIDE, v.i.  To succumb to the preponderance of one set of influences over another set.
DEFAME, v.t.  To lie about another.  To tell the truth about another.
DEFENCELESS, adj.  Unable to attack.
DEGENERATE, adj.  Less conspicuously admirable than one's ancestors. The contemporaries of Homer were striking examples of degeneracy; it required ten of them to raise a rock or a riot that one of the heroes of the Trojan war could have raised with ease.  Homer never tires of sneering at "men who live in these degenerate days," which is perhaps why they suffered him to beg his bread—a marked instance of returning good for evil, by the way, for if they had forbidden him he would certainly have starved.
DEGRADATION, n.  One of the stages of moral and social progress from private station to political preferment.
DEINOTHERIUM, n.  An extinct pachyderm that flourished when the Pterodactyl was in fashion.  The latter was a native of Ireland, its name being pronounced Terry Dactyl or Peter O'Dactyl, as the man pronouncing it may chance to have heard it spoken or seen it printed.

DEPUTY, n.  A male relative of an office-holder, or of his bondsman. The deputy is commonly a beautiful young man, with a red necktie and an intricate system of cobwebs extending from his nose to his desk. When accidentally struck by the janitor's broom, he gives off a cloud of dust.
DESTINY, n.  A tyrant's authority for crime and fool's excuse for failure.
DIAGNOSIS, n.  A physician's forecast of the disease by the patient's pulse and purse.
DIAPHRAGM, n.  A muscular partition separating disorders of the chest from disorders of the bowels.
DIARY, n.  A daily record of that part of one's life, which he can relate to himself without blushing.
DICTATOR, n.  The chief of a nation that prefers the pestilence of despotism to the plague of anarchy.
DICTIONARY, n.  A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic.  This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.
DIE, n.  The singular of "dice."  We seldom hear the word, because there is a prohibitory proverb, "Never say die."  At long intervals, however, some one says:  "The die is cast," which is not true, for it is cut.  The word is found in an immortal couplet by that eminent poet and domestic economist, Senator Depew:
DIGESTION, n.  The conversion of victuals into virtues.  When the process is imperfect, vices are evolved instead—a circumstance from which that wicked writer, Dr. Jeremiah Blenn, infers that the ladies are the greater sufferers from dyspepsia.
DIPLOMACY, n.  The patriotic art of lying for one's country.
DISABUSE, v.t.  The present your neighbor with another and better error than the one which he has deemed it advantageous to embrace.
DISCRIMINATE, v.i.  To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another.
DISCUSSION, n.  A method of confirming others in their errors.
DISOBEDIENCE, n.  The silver lining to the cloud of servitude.
DISOBEY, v.t.  To celebrate with an appropriate ceremony the maturity of a command.
DISSEMBLE, v.i.  To put a clean shirt upon the character.
DISTANCE, n.  The only thing that the rich are willing for the poor to call theirs, and keep.
DISTRESS, n.  A disease incurred by exposure to the prosperity of a friend.
DIVINATION, n.  The art of nosing out the occult.  Divination is of as many kinds as there are fruit-bearing varieties of the flowering dunce and the early fool.
DOG, n.  A kind of additional or subsidiary Deity designed to catch the overflow and surplus of the world's worship.  This Divine Being in some of his smaller and silkier incarnations takes, in the affection of Woman, the place to which there is no human male aspirant.  The Dog is a survival—an anachronism.  He toils not, neither does he spin, yet Solomon in all his glory never lay upon a door-mat all day long, sun-soaked and fly-fed and fat, while his master worked for the means wherewith to purchase the idle wag of the Solomonic tail, seasoned with a look of tolerant recognition.
DRAGOON, n.  A soldier who combines dash and steadiness in so equal measure that he makes his advances on foot and his retreats on horseback.
DRAMATIST, n.  One who adapts plays from the French.
DRUIDS, n.  Priests and ministers of an ancient Celtic religion which did not disdain to employ the humble allurement of human sacrifice. Very little is now known about the Druids and their faith.  Pliny says their religion, originating in Britain, spread eastward as far as Persia.  Caesar says those who desired to study its mysteries went to Britain.  Caesar himself went to Britain, but does not appear to have obtained any high preferment in the Druidical Church, although his talent for human sacrifice was considerable.
DUCK-BILL, n.  Your account at your restaurant during the canvas-back season.
DUEL, n.  A formal ceremony preliminary to the reconciliation of two enemies.  Great skill is necessary to its satisfactory observance; if awkwardly performed the most unexpected and deplorable consequences sometimes ensue.  A long time ago a man lost his life in a duel.
DULLARD, n.  A member of the reigning dynasty in letters and life. The Dullards came in with Adam, and being both numerous and sturdy have overrun the habitable world.  The secret of their power is their insensibility to blows; tickle them with a bludgeon and they laugh with a platitude.  The Dullards came originally from Boeotia, whence they were driven by stress of starvation, their dullness having blighted the crops.  For some centuries they infested Philistia, and many of them are called Philistines to this day.  In the turbulent times of the Crusades they withdrew thence and gradually overspread all Europe, occupying most of the high places in politics, art, literature, science and theology.  Since a detachment of Dullards came over with the Pilgrims in the _Mayflower_ and made a favorable report of the country, their increase by birth, immigration, and conversion has been rapid and steady.  According to the most trustworthy statistics the number of adult Dullards in the United States is but little short of thirty millions, including the statisticians.  The intellectual centre of the race is somewhere about Peoria, Illinois, but the New England Dullard is the most shockingly moral.
DUTY, n.  That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit, along the line of desire.
EAT, v.i.  To perform successively (and successfully) the functions of mastication, humectation, and deglutition.
EAVESDROP, v.i.  Secretly to overhear a catalogue of the crimes and vices of another or yourself.
ECCENTRICITY, n.  A method of distinction so cheap that fools employ it to accentuate their incapacity.
ECONOMY, n.  Purchasing the barrel of whiskey that you do not need for the price of the cow that you cannot afford.
EDIBLE, adj.  Good to eat, and wholesome to digest, as a worm to a toad, a toad to a snake, a snake to a pig, a pig to a man, and a man to a worm.
EDITOR, n.  A person who combines the judicial functions of Minos, Rhadamanthus and Aeacus, but is placable with an obolus; a severely virtuous censor, but so charitable withal that he tolerates the virtues of others and the vices of himself; who flings about him the splintering lightning and sturdy thunders of admonition till he resembles a bunch of firecrackers petulantly uttering his mind at the tail of a dog; then straightway murmurs a mild, melodious lay, soft as the cooing of a donkey intoning its prayer to the evening star. Master of mysteries and lord of law, high-pinnacled upon the throne of thought, his face suffused with the dim splendors of the Transfiguration, his legs intertwisted and his tongue a-cheek, the editor spills his will along the paper and cuts it off in lengths to suit.  And at intervals from behind the veil of the temple is heard the voice of the foreman demanding three inches of wit and six lines of religious meditation, or bidding him turn off the wisdom and whack up some pathos.
EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding.
EFFECT, n.  The second of two phenomena which always occur together in the same order.  The first, called a Cause, is said to generate the other—which is no more sensible than it would be for one who has never seen a dog except in the pursuit of a rabbit to declare the rabbit the cause of a dog.
EGOTIST, n.  A person of low taste, more interested in himself than in me.
EJECTION, n.  An approved remedy for the disease of garrulity.  It is also much used in cases of extreme poverty.
ELECTOR, n.  One who enjoys the sacred privilege of voting for the man of another man's choice.
ELECTRICITY, n.  The power that causes all natural phenomena not known to be caused by something else.  It is the same thing as lightning, and its famous attempt to strike Dr. Franklin is one of the most picturesque incidents in that great and good man's career.  The memory of Dr. Franklin is justly held in great reverence, particularly in France, where a waxen effigy of him was recently on exhibition, bearing the following touching account of his life and services to science:
ELEGY, n.  A composition in verse, in which, without employing any of the methods of humor, the writer aims to produce in the reader's mind the dampest kind of dejection.  The most famous English example begins somewhat like this:
ELOQUENCE, n.  The art of orally persuading fools that white is the color that it appears to be.  It includes the gift of making any color appear white.
ELYSIUM, n.  An imaginary delightful country which the ancients foolishly believed to be inhabited by the spirits of the good.  This ridiculous and mischievous fable was swept off the face of the earth by the early Christians—may their souls be happy in Heaven!
EMANCIPATION, n.  A bondman's change from the tyranny of another to the despotism of himself.
EMBALM, v.i.  To cheat vegetation by locking up the gases upon which it feeds.  By embalming their dead and thereby deranging the natural balance between animal and vegetable life, the Egyptians made their once fertile and populous country barren and incapable of supporting more than a meagre crew.  The modern metallic burial casket is a step in the same direction, and many a dead man who ought now to be ornamenting his neighbor's lawn as a tree, or enriching his table as a bunch of radishes, is doomed to a long inutility.  We shall get him after awhile if we are spared, but in the meantime the violet and rose are languishing for a nibble at his _glutoeus maximus_.
EMOTION, n.  A prostrating disease caused by a determination of the heart to the head.  It is sometimes accompanied by a copious discharge of hydrated chloride of sodium from the eyes.
ENCOMIAST, n.  A special (but not particular) kind of liar.
END, n.  The position farthest removed on either hand from the Interlocutor.
ENOUGH, pro.  All there is in the world if you like it.
ENTERTAINMENT, n.  Any kind of amusement whose inroads stop short of death by injection.
ENTHUSIASM, n.  A distemper of youth, curable by small doses of repentance in connection with outward applications of experience. Byron, who recovered long enough to call it "entuzy-muzy," had a relapse, which carried him off—to Missolonghi.
ENVELOPE, n.  The coffin of a document; the scabbard of a bill; the husk of a remittance; the bed-gown of a love-letter.
ENVY, n.  Emulation adapted to the meanest capacity.
EPAULET, n.  An ornamented badge, serving to distinguish a military officer from the enemy—that is to say, from the officer of lower rank to whom his death would give promotion.
EPICURE, n.  An opponent of Epicurus, an abstemious philosopher who, holding that pleasure should be the chief aim of man, wasted no time in gratification from the senses.
EPIGRAM, n.  A short, sharp saying in prose or verse, frequently characterize by acidity or acerbity and sometimes by wisdom. Following are some of the more notable epigrams of the learned and ingenious Dr. Jamrach Holobom:
EPITAPH, n.  An inscription on a tomb, showing that virtues acquired by death have a retroactive effect.  Following is a touching example:
ERUDITION, n.  Dust shaken out of a book into an empty skull.
ESOTERIC, adj.  Very particularly abstruse and consummately occult. The ancient philosophies were of two kinds,—_exoteric_, those that the philosophers themselves could partly understand, and _esoteric_, those that nobody could understand.  It is the latter that have most profoundly affected modern thought and found greatest acceptance in our time.
ETHNOLOGY, n.  The science that treats of the various tribes of Man, as robbers, thieves, swindlers, dunces, lunatics, idiots and ethnologists.
EUCHARIST, n.  A sacred feast of the religious sect of Theophagi.
EULOGY, n.  Praise of a person who has either the advantages of wealth and power, or the consideration to be dead.
EVANGELIST, n.  A bearer of good tidings, particularly (in a religious sense) such as assure us of our own salvation and the damnation of our neighbors.
EVERLASTING, adj.  Lasting forever.  It is with no small diffidence that I venture to offer this brief and elementary definition, for I am not unaware of the existence of a bulky volume by a sometime Bishop of Worcester, entitled, _A Partial Definition of the Word "Everlasting," as Used in the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures_.  His book was once esteemed of great authority in the Anglican Church, and is still, I understand, studied with pleasure to the mind and profit of the soul.
EXCEPTION, n.  A thing which takes the liberty to differ from other things of its class, as an honest man, a truthful woman, etc.  "The exception proves the rule" is an expression constantly upon the lips of the ignorant, who parrot it from one another with never a thought of its absurdity.  In the Latin, "_Exceptio probat regulam_" means that the exception _tests_ the rule, puts it to the proof, not _confirms_ it.  The malefactor who drew the meaning from this excellent dictum and substituted a contrary one of his own exerted an evil power which appears to be immortal.
EXCESS, n.  In morals, an indulgence that enforces by appropriate penalties the law of moderation.
EXECUTIVE, n.  An officer of the Government, whose duty it is to enforce the wishes of the legislative power until such time as the judicial department shall be pleased to pronounce them invalid and of no effect.  Following is an extract from an old book entitled, _The Lunarian Astonished_—Pfeiffer & Co., Boston, 1803:
EXHORT, v.t. In religious affairs, to put the conscience of another upon the spit and roast it to a nut-brown discomfort.
EXILE, n.  One who serves his country by residing abroad, yet is not an ambassador.
EXPERIENCE, n.  The wisdom that enables us to recognize as an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced.
EXPOSTULATION, n.  One of the many methods by which fools prefer to lose their friends.
EXTINCTION, n.  The raw material out of which theology created the future state.
FAIRY, n.  A creature, variously fashioned and endowed, that formerly inhabited the meadows and forests.  It was nocturnal in its habits, and somewhat addicted to dancing and the theft of children.  The fairies are now believed by naturalist to be extinct, though a clergyman of the Church of England saw three near Colchester as lately as 1855, while passing through a park after dining with the lord of the manor.  The sight greatly staggered him, and he was so affected that his account of it was incoherent.  In the year 1807 a troop of fairies visited a wood near Aix and carried off the daughter of a peasant, who had been seen to enter it with a bundle of clothing.  The son of a wealthy _bourgeois_ disappeared about the same time, but afterward returned.  He had seen the abduction been in pursuit of the fairies.  Justinian Gaux, a writer of the fourteenth century, avers that so great is the fairies' power of transformation that he saw one change itself into two opposing armies and fight a battle with great slaughter, and that the next day, after it had resumed its original shape and gone away, there were seven hundred bodies of the slain which the villagers had to bury.  He does not say if any of the wounded recovered.  In the time of Henry III, of England, a law was made which prescribed the death penalty for "Kyllynge, wowndynge, or mamynge" a fairy, and it was universally respected.
FAITH, n.  Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel.
FAMOUS, adj.  Conspicuously miserable.
FASHION, n.  A despot whom the wise ridicule and obey.
FEAST, n.  A festival.  A religious celebration usually signalized by gluttony and drunkenness, frequently in honor of some holy person distinguished for abstemiousness.  In the Roman Catholic Church feasts are "movable" and "immovable," but the celebrants are uniformly immovable until they are full.  In their earliest development these entertainments took the form of feasts for the dead; such were held by the Greeks, under the name _Nemeseia_, by the Aztecs and Peruvians, as in modern times they are popular with the Chinese; though it is believed that the ancient dead, like the modern, were light eaters. Among the many feasts of the Romans was the _Novemdiale_, which was held, according to Livy, whenever stones fell from heaven.
FELON, n.  A person of greater enterprise than discretion, who in embracing an opportunity has formed an unfortunate attachment.
FEMALE, n.  One of the opposing, or unfair, sex.
FIB, n.  A lie that has not cut its teeth.  An habitual liar's nearest approach to truth:  the perigee of his eccentric orbit.
FICKLENESS, n.  The iterated satiety of an enterprising affection.
FIDDLE, n.  An instrument to tickle human ears by friction of a horse's tail on the entrails of a cat.
FIDELITY, n.  A virtue peculiar to those who are about to be betrayed.
FINANCE, n.  The art or science of managing revenues and resources for the best advantage of the manager.  The pronunciation of this word with the i long and the accent on the first syllable is one of America's most precious discoveries and possessions.
FLAG, n.  A colored rag borne above troops and hoisted on forts and ships.  It appears to serve the same purpose as certain signs that one sees and vacant lots in London—"Rubbish may be shot here."
FLESH, n.  The Second Person of the secular Trinity.
FLOP, v.  Suddenly to change one's opinions and go over to another party.  The most notable flop on record was that of Saul of Tarsus, who has been severely criticised as a turn-coat by some of our partisan journals.
FLY-SPECK, n.  The prototype of punctuation.  It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in use by the various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries.  These creatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of the work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the writer's powers.  The "old masters" of literature—that is to say, the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same language—never punctuated at all, but worked right along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which comes from the use of points.  (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.)  In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly—_Musca maledicta_. In transcribing these ancientMSS, for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of punctuation, which is no small glory.  Fully to understand the important services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe "how the wit brightens and the style refines" in accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.
FOLLY, n.  That "gift and faculty divine" whose creative and controlling energy inspires Man's mind, guides his actions and adorns his life.
FOOL, n.  A person who pervades the domain of intellectual speculation and diffuses himself through the channels of moral activity.  He is omnific, omniform, omnipercipient, omniscient, omnipotent.  He it was who invented letters, printing, the railroad, the steamboat, the telegraph, the platitude and the circle of the sciences.  He created patriotism and taught the nations war—founded theology, philosophy, law, medicine and Chicago.  He established monarchical and republican government.  He is from everlasting to everlasting—such as creation's dawn beheld he fooleth now.  In the morning of time he sang upon primitive hills, and in the noonday of existence headed the procession of being.  His grandmotherly hand was warmly tucked-in the set sun of civilization, and in the twilight he prepares Man's evening meal of milk-and-morality and turns down the covers of the universal grave.  And after the rest of us shall have retired for the night of eternal oblivion he will sit up to write a history of human civilization.
FOREFINGER, n.  The finger commonly used in pointing out two malefactors.
FOREORDINATION, n.  This looks like an easy word to define, but when I consider that pious and learned theologians have spent long lives in explaining it, and written libraries to explain their explanations; when I remember the nations have been divided and bloody battles caused by the difference between foreordination and predestination, and that millions of treasure have been expended in the effort to prove and disprove its compatibility with freedom of the will and the efficacy of prayer, praise, and a religious life,—recalling these awful facts in the history of the word, I stand appalled before the mighty problem of its signification, abase my spiritual eyes, fearing to contemplate its portentous magnitude, reverently uncover and humbly refer it to His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons and His Grace Bishop Potter.
FORGETFULNESS, n.  A gift of God bestowed upon doctors in compensation for their destitution of conscience.
FORK, n.  An instrument used chiefly for the purpose of putting dead animals into the mouth.  Formerly the knife was employed for this purpose, and by many worthy persons is still thought to have many advantages over the other tool, which, however, they do not altogether reject, but use to assist in charging the knife.  The immunity of these persons from swift and awful death is one of the most striking proofs of God's mercy to those that hate Him.
FRANKALMOIGNE, n.  The tenure by which a religious corporation holds lands on condition of praying for the soul of the donor.  In mediaeval times many of the wealthiest fraternities obtained their estates in this simple and cheap manner, and once when Henry VIII of England sent an officer to confiscate certain vast possessions which a fraternity of monks held by frankalmoigne, "What!" said the Prior, "would you master stay our benefactor's soul in Purgatory?"  "Ay," said the officer, coldly, "an ye will not pray him thence for naught he must e'en roast."  "But look you, my son," persisted the good man, "this act hath rank as robbery of God!"  "Nay, nay, good father, my master the king doth but deliver him from the manifold temptations of too great wealth."
FREEBOOTER, n.  A conqueror in a small way of business, whose annexations lack of the sanctifying merit of magnitude.
FREEDOM, n.  Exemption from the stress of authority in a beggarly half dozen of restraint's infinite multitude of methods.  A political condition that every nation supposes itself to enjoy in virtual monopoly.  Liberty.  The distinction between freedom and liberty is not accurately known; naturalists have never been able to find a living specimen of either.
FREEMASONS, n.  An order with secret rites, grotesque ceremonies and fantastic costumes, which, originating in the reign of Charles II, among working artisans of London, has been joined successively by the dead of past centuries in unbroken retrogression until now it embraces all the generations of man on the hither side of Adam and is drumming up distinguished recruits among the pre-Creational inhabitants of Chaos and Formless Void.  The order was founded at different times by Charlemagne, Julius Caesar, Cyrus, Solomon, Zoroaster, Confucious, Thothmes, and Buddha.  Its emblems and symbols have been found in the Catacombs of Paris and Rome, on the stones of the Parthenon and the Chinese Great Wall, among the temples of Karnak and Palmyra and in the Egyptian Pyramids—always by a Freemason.
FRIENDLESS, adj.  Having no favors to bestow.  Destitute of fortune. Addicted to utterance of truth and common sense.
FRIENDSHIP, n.  A ship big enough to carry two in fair weather, but only one in foul.
FROG, n.  A reptile with edible legs.  The first mention of frogs in profane literature is in Homer's narrative of the war between them and the mice.  Skeptical persons have doubted Homer's authorship of the work, but the learned, ingenious and industrious Dr. Schliemann has set the question forever at rest by uncovering the bones of the slain frogs.  One of the forms of moral suasion by which Pharaoh was besought to favor the Israelities was a plague of frogs, but Pharaoh, who liked them _fricasees_, remarked, with truly oriental stoicism, that he could stand it as long as the frogs and the Jews could; so the programme was changed.  The frog is a diligent songster, having a good voice but no ear.  The libretto of his favorite opera, as written by Aristophanes, is brief, simple and effective—"brekekex-koax"; the music is apparently by that eminent composer, Richard Wagner.  Horses have a frog in each hoof—a thoughtful provision of nature, enabling them to shine in a hurdle race.
FRYING-PAN, n.  One part of the penal apparatus employed in that punitive institution, a woman's kitchen.  The frying-pan was invented by Calvin, and by him used in cooking span-long infants that had died without baptism; and observing one day the horrible torment of a tramp who had incautiously pulled a fried babe from the waste-dump and devoured it, it occurred to the great divine to rob death of its terrors by introducing the frying-pan into every household in Geneva. Thence it spread to all corners of the world, and has been of invaluable assistance in the propagation of his sombre faith.  The following lines (said to be from the pen of his Grace Bishop Potter) seem to imply that the usefulness of this utensil is not limited to this world; but as the consequences of its employment in this life reach over into the life to come, so also itself may be found on the other side, rewarding its devotees:
FUNERAL, n.  A pageant whereby we attest our respect for the dead by enriching the undertaker, and strengthen our grief by an expenditure that deepens our groans and doubles our tears.
FUTURE, n.  That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured.
GALLOWS, n.  A stage for the performance of miracle plays, in which the leading actor is translated to heaven.  In this country the gallows is chiefly remarkable for the number of persons who escape it.
GARGOYLE, n.  A rain-spout projecting from the eaves of mediaeval buildings, commonly fashioned into a grotesque caricature of some personal enemy of the architect or owner of the building.  This was especially the case in churches and ecclesiastical structures generally, in which the gargoyles presented a perfect rogues' gallery of local heretics and controversialists.  Sometimes when a new dean and chapter were installed the old gargoyles were removed and others substituted having a closer relation to the private animosities of the new incumbents.
GARTHER, n.  An elastic band intended to keep a woman from coming out of her stockings and desolating the country.
GENEROUS, adj.  Originally this word meant noble by birth and was rightly applied to a great multitude of persons.  It now means noble by nature and is taking a bit of a rest.
GENEALOGY, n.  An account of one's descent from an ancestor who did not particularly care to trace his own.
GENTEEL, adj.  Refined, after the fashion of a gent.
GEOGRAPHER, n.  A chap who can tell you offhand the difference between the outside of the world and the inside.
GEOLOGY, n.  The science of the earth's crust—to which, doubtless, will be added that of its interior whenever a man shall come up garrulous out of a well.  The geological formations of the globe already noted are catalogued thus:  The Primary, or lower one, consists of rocks, bones or mired mules, gas-pipes, miners' tools, antique statues minus the nose, Spanish doubloons and ancestors.  The Secondary is largely made up of red worms and moles.  The Tertiary comprises railway tracks, patent pavements, grass, snakes, mouldy boots, beer bottles, tomato cans, intoxicated citizens, garbage, anarchists, snap-dogs and fools.
GHOST, n.  The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.
GHOUL, n.  A demon addicted to the reprehensible habit of devouring the dead.  The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of comforting beliefs than to give it anything good in their place.  In 1640 Father Secchi saw one in a cemetery near Florence and frightened it away with the sign of the cross.  He describes it as gifted with many heads an an uncommon allowance of limbs, and he saw it in more than one place at a time.  The good man was coming away from dinner at the time and explains that if he had not been "heavy with eating" he would have seized the demon at all hazards.  Atholston relates that a ghoul was caught by some sturdy peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury and ducked in a horsepond.  (He appears to think that so distinguished a criminal should have been ducked in a tank of rosewater.)  The water turned at once to blood "and so contynues unto ys daye."  The pond has since been bled with a ditch.  As late as the beginning of the fourteenth century a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of the cathedral at Amiens and the whole population surrounded the place.  Twenty armed men with a priest at their head, bearing a crucifix, entered and captured the ghoul, which, thinking to escape by the stratagem, had transformed itself to the semblance of a well known citizen, but was nevertheless hanged, drawn and quartered in the midst of hideous popular orgies.  The citizen whose shape the demon had assumed was so affected by the sinister occurrence that he never again showed himself in Amiens and his fate remains a mystery.
GLUTTON, n.  A person who escapes the evils of moderation by committing dyspepsia.
GNOME, n.  In North-European mythology, a dwarfish imp inhabiting the interior parts of the earth and having special custody of mineral treasures.  Bjorsen, who died in 1765, says gnomes were common enough in the southern parts of Sweden in his boyhood, and he frequently saw them scampering on the hills in the evening twilight.  Ludwig Binkerhoof saw three as recently as 1792, in the Black Forest, and Sneddeker avers that in 1803 they drove a party of miners out of a Silesian mine.  Basing our computations upon data supplied by these statements, we find that the gnomes were probably extinct as early as 1764.
GNOSTICS, n.  A sect of philosophers who tried to engineer a fusion between the early Christians and the Platonists.  The former would not go into the caucus and the combination failed, greatly to the chagrin of the fusion managers.
GNU, n.  An animal of South Africa, which in its domesticated state resembles a horse, a buffalo and a stag.  In its wild condition it is something like a thunderbolt, an earthquake and a cyclone.
GOOD, adj.  Sensible, madam, to the worth of this present writer. Alive, sir, to the advantages of letting him alone.
GOOSE, n.  A bird that supplies quills for writing.  These, by some occult process of nature, are penetrated and suffused with various degrees of the bird's intellectual energies and emotional character, so that when inked and drawn mechanically across paper by a person called an "author," there results a very fair and accurate transcript of the fowl's thought and feeling.  The difference in geese, as discovered by this ingenious method, is considerable:  many are found to have only trivial and insignificant powers, but some are seen to be very great geese indeed.
GOUT, n.  A physician's name for the rheumatism of a rich patient.
GRACES, n.  Three beautiful goddesses, Aglaia, Thalia and Euphrosyne, who attended upon Venus, serving without salary.  They were at no expense for board and clothing, for they ate nothing to speak of and dressed according to the weather, wearing whatever breeze happened to be blowing.
GRAMMAR, n.  A system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for the feet for the self-made man, along the path by which he advances to distinction.
GRAPESHOT, n.  An argument which the future is preparing in answer to the demands of American Socialism.
GRAVE, n.  A place in which the dead are laid to await the coming of the medical student.
GRAVITATION, n.  The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a strength proportion to the quantity of matter they contain— the quantity of matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their tendency to approach one another.  This is a lovely and edifying illustration of how science, having made A the proof of B, makes B the proof of A.
GUILLOTINE, n.  A machine which makes a Frenchman shrug his shoulders with good reason.
GUNPOWDER, n.  An agency employed by civilized nations for the settlement of disputes which might become troublesome if left unadjusted.  By most writers the invention of gunpowder is ascribed to the Chinese, but not upon very convincing evidence.  Milton says it was invented by the devil to dispel angels with, and this opinion seems to derive some support from the scarcity of angels.  Moreover, it has the hearty concurrence of the Hon. James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture.
HABIT, n.  A shackle for the free.
HADES, n.  The lower world; the residence of departed spirits; the place where the dead live.
HAG, n.  An elderly lady whom you do not happen to like; sometimes called, also, a hen, or cat.  Old witches, sorceresses, etc., were called hags from the belief that their heads were surrounded by a kind of baleful lumination or nimbus—hag being the popular name of that peculiar electrical light sometimes observed in the hair.  At one time hag was not a word of reproach:  Drayton speaks of a "beautiful hag, all smiles," much as Shakespeare said, "sweet wench."  It would not now be proper to call your sweetheart a hag—that compliment is reserved for the use of her grandchildren.
HALF, n.  One of two equal parts into which a thing may be divided, or considered as divided.  In the fourteenth century a heated discussion arose among theologists and philosophers as to whether Omniscience could part an object into three halves; and the pious Father Aldrovinus publicly prayed in the cathedral at Rouen that God would demonstrate the affirmative of the proposition in some signal and unmistakable way, and particularly (if it should please Him) upon the body of that hardy blasphemer, Manutius Procinus, who maintained the negative.  Procinus, however, was spared to die of the bite of a viper.
HALO, n.  Properly, a luminous ring encircling an astronomical body, but not infrequently confounded with "aureola," or "nimbus," a somewhat similar phenomenon worn as a head-dress by divinities and saints.  The halo is a purely optical illusion, produced by moisture in the air, in the manner of a rainbow; but the aureola is conferred as a sign of superior sanctity, in the same way as a bishop's mitre, or the Pope's tiara.  In the painting of the Nativity, by Szedgkin, a pious artist of Pesth, not only do the Virgin and the Child wear the nimbus, but an ass nibbling hay from the sacred manger is similarly decorated and, to his lasting honor be it said, appears to bear his unaccustomed dignity with a truly saintly grace.
HAND, n.  A singular instrument worn at the end of the human arm and commonly thrust into somebody's pocket.
HANDKERCHIEF, n.  A small square of silk or linen, used in various ignoble offices about the face and especially serviceable at funerals to conceal the lack of tears.  The handkerchief is of recent invention; our ancestors knew nothing of it and intrusted its duties to the sleeve.  Shakespeare's introducing it into the play of "Othello" is an anachronism:  Desdemona dried her nose with her skirt, as Dr. Mary Walker and other reformers have done with their coattails in our own day—an evidence that revolutions sometimes go backward.
HANGMAN, n.  An officer of the law charged with duties of the highest dignity and utmost gravity, and held in hereditary disesteem by a populace having a criminal ancestry.  In some of the American States his functions are now performed by an electrician, as in New Jersey, where executions by electricity have recently been ordered—the first instance known to this lexicographer of anybody questioning the expediency of hanging Jerseymen.
HAPPINESS, n.  An agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of another.
HARANGUE, n.  A speech by an opponent, who is known as an harangue-outang.
HARBOR, n.  A place where ships taking shelter from stores are exposed to the fury of the customs.
HARMONISTS, n.  A sect of Protestants, now extinct, who came from Europe in the beginning of the last century and were distinguished for the bitterness of their internal controversies and dissensions.
HASH, x.  There is no definition for this word—nobody knows what hash is.
HATCHET, n.  A young axe, known among Indians as a Thomashawk.
HATRED, n.  A sentiment appropriate to the occasion of another's superiority.
HEAD-MONEY, n.  A capitation tax, or poll-tax.
HEARSE, n.  Death's baby-carriage.
HEART, n.  An automatic, muscular blood-pump.  Figuratively, this useful organ is said to be the seat of emotions and sentiments—a very pretty fancy which, however, is nothing but a survival of a once universal belief.  It is now known that the sentiments and emotions reside in the stomach, being evolved from food by chemical action of the gastric fluid.  The exact process by which a beefsteak becomes a feeling—tender or not, according to the age of the animal from which it was cut; the successive stages of elaboration through which a caviar sandwich is transmuted to a quaint fancy and reappears as a pungent epigram; the marvelous functional methods of converting a hard-boiled egg into religious contrition, or a cream-puff into a sigh of sensibility—these things have been patiently ascertained by M. Pasteur, and by him expounded with convincing lucidity.  (See, also, my monograph, _The Essential Identity of the Spiritual Affections and Certain Intestinal Gases Freed in Digestion_—4to, 687 pp.)  In a scientific work entitled, I believe, _Delectatio Demonorum_ (John Camden Hotton, London, 1873) this view of the sentiments receives a striking illustration; and for further light consult Professor Dam's famous treatise on _Love as a Product of Alimentary Maceration_.
HEATHEN, n.  A benighted creature who has the folly to worship something that he can see and feel.  According to Professor Howison, of the California State University, Hebrews are heathens.
HEAVEN, n.  A place where the wicked cease from troubling you with talk of their personal affairs, and the good listen with attention while you expound your own.
HEBREW, n.  A male Jew, as distinguished from the Shebrew, an altogether superior creation.
HELPMATE, n.  A wife, or bitter half.
HEMP, n.  A plant from whose fibrous bark is made an article of neckwear which is frequently put on after public speaking in the open air and prevents the wearer from taking cold.
HERMIT, n.  A person whose vices and follies are not sociable.
HERS, pron.  His.
HIBERNATE, v.i.  To pass the winter season in domestic seclusion. There have been many singular popular notions about the hibernation of various animals.  Many believe that the bear hibernates during the whole winter and subsists by mechanically sucking its paws.  It is admitted that it comes out of its retirement in the spring so lean that it had to try twice before it can cast a shadow.  Three or four centuries ago, in England, no fact was better attested than that swallows passed the winter months in the mud at the bottom of their brooks, clinging together in globular masses.  They have apparently been compelled to give up the custom and account of the foulness of the brooks.  Sotus Ecobius discovered in Central Asia a whole nation of people who hibernate.  By some investigators, the fasting of Lent is supposed to have been originally a modified form of hibernation, to which the Church gave a religious significance; but this view was strenuously opposed by that eminent authority, Bishop Kip, who did not wish any honors denied to the memory of the Founder of his family.
HIPPOGRIFF, n.  An animal (now extinct) which was half horse and half griffin.  The griffin was itself a compound creature, half lion and half eagle.  The hippogriff was actually, therefore, a one-quarter eagle, which is two dollars and fifty cents in gold.  The study of zoology is full of surprises.
HISTORIAN, n.  A broad-gauge gossip.
HISTORY, n.  An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.
HOG, n.  A bird remarkable for the catholicity of its appetite and serving to illustrate that of ours.  Among the Mahometans and Jews, the hog is not in favor as an article of diet, but is respected for the delicacy and the melody of its voice.  It is chiefly as a songster that the fowl is esteemed; the cage of him in full chorus has been known to draw tears from two persons at once.  The scientific name of this dicky-bird is _Porcus Rockefelleri_.  Mr. Rockefeller did not discover the hog, but it is considered his by right of resemblance.
HOMOEOPATHIST, n.  The humorist of the medical profession.
HOMOEOPATHY, n.  A school of medicine midway between Allopathy and Christian Science.  To the last both the others are distinctly inferior, for Christian Science will cure imaginary diseases, and they can not.
HOMICIDE, n.  The slaying of one human being by another.  There are four kinds of homocide:  felonious, excusable, justifiable, and praiseworthy, but it makes no great difference to the person slain whether he fell by one kind or another—the classification is for advantage of the lawyers.
HOMILETICS, n.  The science of adapting sermons to the spiritual needs, capacities and conditions of the congregation.
HONORABLE, adj.  Afflicted with an impediment in one's reach.  In legislative bodies it is customary to mention all members as honorable; as, "the honorable gentleman is a scurvy cur."
HOPE, n.  Desire and expectation rolled into one.
HOSPITALITY, n.  The virtue which induces us to feed and lodge certain persons who are not in need of food and lodging.
HOSTILITY, n.  A peculiarly sharp and specially applied sense of the earth's overpopulation.  Hostility is classified as active and passive; as (respectively) the feeling of a woman for her female friends, and that which she entertains for all the rest of her sex.
HOURI, n.  A comely female inhabiting the Mohammedan Paradise to make things cheery for the good Mussulman, whose belief in her existence marks a noble discontent with his earthly spouse, whom he denies a soul.  By that good lady the Houris are said to be held in deficient esteem.
HOUSE, n.  A hollow edifice erected for the habitation of man, rat, mouse, beetle, cockroach, fly, mosquito, flea, bacillus and microbe. _House of Correction_, a place of reward for political and personal service, and for the detention of offenders and appropriations. _House of God_, a building with a steeple and a mortgage on it. _House-dog_, a pestilent beast kept on domestic premises to insult persons passing by and appal the hardy visitor.  _House-maid_, a youngerly person of the opposing sex employed to be variously disagreeable and ingeniously unclean in the station in which it has pleased God to place her.
HOUSELESS, adj.  Having paid all taxes on household goods.
HOVEL, n.  The fruit of a flower called the Palace.
HUMANITY, n.  The human race, collectively, exclusive of the anthropoid poets.
HUMORIST, n.  A plague that would have softened down the hoar austerity of Pharaoh's heart and persuaded him to dismiss Israel with his best wishes, cat-quick.
HURRICANE, n.  An atmospheric demonstration once very common but now generally abandoned for the tornado and cyclone.  The hurricane is still in popular use in the West Indies and is preferred by certain old-fashioned sea-captains.  It is also used in the construction of the upper decks of steamboats, but generally speaking, the hurricane's usefulness has outlasted it.
HURRY, n.  The dispatch of bunglers.
HUSBAND, n.  One who, having dined, is charged with the care of the plate.
HYBRID, n.  A pooled issue.
HYDRA, n.  A kind of animal that the ancients catalogued under many heads.
HYENA, n.  A beast held in reverence by some oriental nations from its habit of frequenting at night the burial-places of the dead.  But the medical student does that.
HYPOCHONDRIASIS, n.  Depression of one's own spirits.
HYPOCRITE, n.  One who, profession virtues that he does not respect secures the advantage of seeming to be what he despises.
ICHOR, n.  A fluid that serves the gods and goddesses in place of blood.
ICONOCLAST, n.  A breaker of idols, the worshipers whereof are imperfectly gratified by the performance, and most strenuously protest that he unbuildeth but doth not reedify, that he pulleth down but pileth not up.  For the poor things would have other idols in place of those he thwacketh upon the mazzard and dispelleth.  But the iconoclast saith:  "Ye shall have none at all, for ye need them not; and if the rebuilder fooleth round hereabout, behold I will depress the head of him and sit thereon till he squawk it."
IDIOT, n.  A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling.  The Idiot's activity is not confined to any special field of thought or action, but "pervades and regulates the whole."  He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable.  He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line.
IDLENESS, n.  A model farm where the devil experiments with seeds of new sins and promotes the growth of staple vices.
IGNORAMUS, n.  A person unacquainted with certain kinds of knowledge familiar to yourself, and having certain other kinds that you know nothing about.
ILLUMINATI, n.  A sect of Spanish heretics of the latter part of the sixteenth century; so called because they were light weights— _cunctationes illuminati_.
ILLUSTRIOUS, adj.  Suitably placed for the shafts of malice, envy and detraction.
IMAGINATION, n.  A warehouse of facts, with poet and liar in joint ownership.
IMBECILITY, n.  A kind of divine inspiration, or sacred fire affecting censorious critics of this dictionary.
IMMIGRANT, n.  An unenlightened person who thinks one country better than another.
IMMODEST, adj.  Having a strong sense of one's own merit, coupled with a feeble conception of worth in others.
IMMORAL, adj.  Inexpedient.  Whatever in the long run and with regard to the greater number of instances men find to be generally inexpedient comes to be considered wrong, wicked, immoral.  If man's notions of right and wrong have any other basis than this of expediency; if they originated, or could have originated, in any other way; if actions have in themselves a moral character apart from, and nowise dependent on, their consequences—then all philosophy is a lie and reason a disorder of the mind.
IMPALE, v.t.  In popular usage to pierce with any weapon which remains fixed in the wound.  This, however, is inaccurate; to impale is, properly, to put to death by thrusting an upright sharp stake into the body, the victim being left in a sitting position.  This was a common mode of punishment among many of the nations of antiquity, and is still in high favor in China and other parts of Asia.  Down to the beginning of the fifteenth century it was widely employed in "churching" heretics and schismatics.  Wolecraft calls it the "stoole of repentynge," and among the common people it was jocularly known as "riding the one legged horse."  Ludwig Salzmann informs us that in Thibet impalement is considered the most appropriate punishment for crimes against religion; and although in China it is sometimes awarded for secular offences, it is most frequently adjudged in cases of sacrilege.  To the person in actual experience of impalement it must be a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil or religious dissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts; but doubtless he would feel a certain satisfaction if able to contemplate himself in the character of a weather-cock on the spire of the True Church.
IMPARTIAL, adj.  Unable to perceive any promise of personal advantage from espousing either side of a controversy or adopting either of two conflicting opinions.
IMPENITENCE, n.  A state of mind intermediate in point of time between sin and punishment.
IMPIETY, n.  Your irreverence toward my deity.
IMPOSITION, n.  The act of blessing or consecrating by the laying on of hands—a ceremony common to many ecclesiastical systems, but performed with the frankest sincerity by the sect known as Thieves.
IMPROVIDENCE, n.  Provision for the needs of to-day from the revenues of to-morrow.
IMPUNITY, n.  Wealth.
INADMISSIBLE, adj.  Not competent to be considered.  Said of certain kinds of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with, and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before themselves alone.  Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous actions, military, political, commercial and of every other kind, are daily undertaken on hearsay evidence.  There is no religion in the world that has any other basis than hearsay evidence.  Revelation is hearsay evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and who are not known to have been sworn in any sense.  Under the rules of evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law.  It cannot be proved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought, that there was such as person as Julius Caesar, such an empire as Assyria.
INAUSPICIOUSLY, adv.  In an unpromising manner, the auspices being unfavorable.  Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any important action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs, or state prophets, some hint of its probable outcome; and one of their favorite and most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the flight of birds—the omens thence derived being called _auspices_. Newspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided that the word—always in the plural—shall mean "patronage" or "management"; as, "The festivities were under the auspices of the Ancient and Honorable Order of Body-Snatchers"; or, "The hilarities were auspicated by the Knights of Hunger."
INCOME, n.  The natural and rational gauge and measure of respectability, the commonly accepted standards being artificial, arbitrary and fallacious; for, as "Sir Sycophas Chrysolater" in the play has justly remarked, "the true use and function of property (in whatsoever it consisteth—coins, or land, or houses, or merchant-stuff, or anything which may be named as holden of right to one's own subservience) as also of honors, titles, preferments and place, and all favor and acquaintance of persons of quality or ableness, are but to get money.  Hence it followeth that all things are truly to be rated as of worth in measure of their serviceableness to that end; and their possessors should take rank in agreement thereto, neither the lord of an unproducing manor, howsoever broad and ancient, nor he who bears an unremunerate dignity, nor yet the pauper favorite of a king, being esteemed of level excellency with him whose riches are of daily accretion; and hardly should they whose wealth is barren claim and rightly take more honor than the poor and unworthy."
INCOMPATIBILITY, n.  In matrimony a similarity of tastes, particularly the taste for domination.  Incompatibility may, however, consist of a meek-eyed matron living just around the corner.  It has even been known to wear a moustache.
INCOMPOSSIBLE, adj.  Unable to exist if something else exists.  Two things are incompossible when the world of being has scope enough for one of them, but not enough for both—as Walt Whitman's poetry and God's mercy to man.  Incompossibility, it will be seen, is only incompatibility let loose.  Instead of such low language as "Go heel yourself—I mean to kill you on sight," the words, "Sir, we are incompossible," would convey and equally significant intimation and in stately courtesy are altogether superior.
INCUBUS, n.  One of a race of highly improper demons who, though probably not wholly extinct, may be said to have seen their best nights.  For a complete account of _incubi_ and _succubi_, including _incubae_ and _succubae_, see the _Liber Demonorum_ of Protassus (Paris, 1328), which contains much curious information that would be out of place in a dictionary intended as a text-book for the public schools.
INCUMBENT, n.  A person of the liveliest interest to the outcumbents.
INDECISION, n.  The chief element of success; "for whereas," saith Sir Thomas Brewbold, "there is but one way to do nothing and divers way to do something, whereof, to a surety, only one is the right way, it followeth that he who from indecision standeth still hath not so many chances of going astray as he who pusheth forwards"—a most clear and satisfactory exposition on the matter.
INDIFFERENT, adj.  Imperfectly sensible to distinctions among things.
INDIGESTION, n.  A disease which the patient and his friends frequently mistake for deep religious conviction and concern for the salvation of mankind.  As the simple Red Man of the western wild put it, with, it must be confessed, a certain force:  "Plenty well, no pray; big bellyache, heap God."
INDISCRETION, n.  The guilt of woman.
INEXPEDIENT, adj.  Not calculated to advance one's interests.
INFANCY, n.  The period of our lives when, according to Wordsworth, "Heaven lies about us."  The world begins lying about us pretty soon afterward.
INFERIAE, n.  [Latin]  Among the Greeks and Romans, sacrifices for propitiation of the _Dii Manes_, or souls of the dead heroes; for the pious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual needs, and had to have a number of makeshift deities, or, as a sailor might say, jury-gods, which they made out of the most unpromising materials.  It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of Agamemnon that Laiaides, a priest of Aulis, was favored with an audience of that illustrious warrior's shade, who prophetically recounted to him the birth of Christ and the triumph of Christianity, giving him also a rapid but tolerably complete review of events down to the reign of Saint Louis.  The narrative ended abruptly at the point, owing to the inconsiderate crowing of a cock, which compelled the ghosted King of Men to scamper back to Hades.  There is a fine mediaeval flavor to this story, and as it has not been traced back further than Pere Brateille, a pious but obscure writer at the court of Saint Louis, we shall probably not err on the side of presumption in considering it apocryphal, though Monsignor Capel's judgment of the matter might be different; and to that I bow—wow.
INFIDEL, n.  In New York, one who does not believe in the Christian religion; in Constantinople, one who does.  (See GIAOUR.)  A kind of scoundrel imperfectly reverent of, and niggardly contributory to, divines, ecclesiastics, popes, parsons, canons, monks, mollahs, voodoos, presbyters, hierophants, prelates, obeah-men, abbes, nuns, missionaries, exhorters, deacons, friars, hadjis, high-priests, muezzins, brahmins, medicine-men, confessors, eminences, elders, primates, prebendaries, pilgrims, prophets, imaums, beneficiaries, clerks, vicars-choral, archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, preachers, padres, abbotesses, caloyers, palmers, curates, patriarchs, bonezs, santons, beadsmen, canonesses, residentiaries, diocesans, deans, subdeans, rural deans, abdals, charm-sellers, archdeacons, hierarchs, class-leaders, incumbents, capitulars, sheiks, talapoins, postulants, scribes, gooroos, precentors, beadles, fakeers, sextons, reverences, revivalists, cenobites, perpetual curates, chaplains, mudjoes, readers, novices, vicars, pastors, rabbis, ulemas, lamas, sacristans, vergers, dervises, lectors, church wardens, cardinals, prioresses, suffragans, acolytes, rectors, cures, sophis, mutifs and pumpums.
INFLUENCE, n.  In politics, a visionary _quo_ given in exchange for a substantial _quid_.
INFRALAPSARIAN, n.  One who ventures to believe that Adam need not have sinned unless he had a mind to—in opposition to the Supralapsarians, who hold that that luckless person's fall was decreed from the beginning.  Infralapsarians are sometimes called Sublapsarians without material effect upon the importance and lucidity of their views about Adam.
INGRATE, n.  One who receives a benefit from another, or is otherwise an object of charity.
INJURY, n.  An offense next in degree of enormity to a slight.
INJUSTICE, n.  A burden which of all those that we load upon others and carry ourselves is lightest in the hands and heaviest upon the back.
INK, n.  A villainous compound of tannogallate of iron, gum-arabic and water, chiefly used to facilitate the infection of idiocy and promote intellectual crime.  The properties of ink are peculiar and contradictory:  it may be used to make reputations and unmake them; to blacken them and to make them white; but it is most generally and acceptably employed as a mortar to bind together the stones of an edifice of fame, and as a whitewash to conceal afterward the rascal quality of the material.  There are men called journalists who have established ink baths which some persons pay money to get into, others to get out of.  Not infrequently it occurs that a person who has paid to get in pays twice as much to get out.
INNATE, adj.  Natural, inherent—as innate ideas, that is to say, ideas that we are born with, having had them previously imparted to us.  The doctrine of innate ideas is one of the most admirable faiths of philosophy, being itself an innate idea and therefore inaccessible to disproof, though Locke foolishly supposed himself to have given it "a black eye."  Among innate ideas may be mentioned the belief in one's ability to conduct a newspaper, in the greatness of one's country, in the superiority of one's civilization, in the importance of one's personal affairs and in the interesting nature of one's diseases.
INSCRIPTION, n.  Something written on another thing.  Inscriptions are of many kinds, but mostly memorial, intended to commemorate the fame of some illustrious person and hand down to distant ages the record of his services and virtues.  To this class of inscriptions belongs the name of John Smith, penciled on the Washington monument.  Following are examples of memorial inscriptions on tombstones:  (See EPITAPH.)
INSURANCE, n.  An ingenious modern game of chance in which the player is permitted to enjoy the comfortable conviction that he is beating the man who keeps the table.
INSURRECTION, n.  An unsuccessful revolution.  Disaffection's failure to substitute misrule for bad government.
INTENTION, n.  The mind's sense of the prevalence of one set of influences over another set; an effect whose cause is the imminence, immediate or remote, of the performance of an involuntary act.
INTERPRETER, n.  One who enables two persons of different languages to understand each other by repeating to each what it would have been to the interpreter's advantage for the other to have said.
INTERREGNUM, n.  The period during which a monarchical country is governed by a warm spot on the cushion of the throne.  The experiment of letting the spot grow cold has commonly been attended by most unhappy results from the zeal of many worthy persons to make it warm again.
INTIMACY, n.  A relation into which fools are providentially drawn for their mutual destruction.
INTRODUCTION, n.  A social ceremony invented by the devil for the gratification of his servants and the plaguing of his enemies.  The introduction attains its most malevolent development in this century, being, indeed, closely related to our political system.  Every American being the equal of every other American, it follows that everybody has the right to know everybody else, which implies the right to introduce without request or permission.  The Declaration of Independence should have read thus:
INVENTOR, n.  A person who makes an ingenious arrangement of wheels, levers and springs, and believes it civilization.
IRRELIGION, n.  The principal one of the great faiths of the world.
ITCH, n.  The patriotism of a Scotchman.
JEALOUS, adj.  Unduly concerned about the preservation of that which can be lost only if not worth keeping.
JESTER, n.  An officer formerly attached to a king's household, whose business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and utterances, the absurdity being attested by his motley costume.  The king himself being attired with dignity, it took the world some centuries to discover that his own conduct and decrees were sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement not only of his court but of all mankind.  The jester was commonly called a fool, but the poets and romancers have ever delighted to represent him as a singularly wise and witty person.  In the circus of to-day the melancholy ghost of the court fool effects the dejection of humbler audiences with the same jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble hall, panged the patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal tears.
JEWS-HARP, n.  An unmusical instrument, played by holding it fast with the teeth and trying to brush it away with the finger.
JOSS-STICKS, n.  Small sticks burned by the Chinese in their pagan tomfoolery, in imitation of certain sacred rites of our holy religion.
JUSTICE, n.  A commodity which is a more or less adulterated condition the State sells to the citizen as a reward for his allegiance, taxes and personal service.
KILL, v.t.  To create a vacancy without nominating a successor.
KILT, n.  A costume sometimes worn by Scotchmen in America and Americans in Scotland.
KINDNESS, n.  A brief preface to ten volumes of exaction.
KING, n.  A male person commonly known in America as a "crowned head," although he never wears a crown and has usually no head to speak of.
KISS, n.  A word invented by the poets as a rhyme for "bliss."  It is supposed to signify, in a general way, some kind of rite or ceremony appertaining to a good understanding; but the manner of its performance is unknown to this lexicographer.
KLEPTOMANIAC, n.  A rich thief.
KORAN, n.  A book which the Mohammedans foolishly believe to have been written by divine inspiration, but which Christians know to be a wicked imposture, contradictory to the Holy Scriptures.
LABOR, n.  One of the processes by which A acquires property for B.
LAND, n.  A part of the earth's surface, considered as property.  The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the superstructure.  Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized.  It follows that if the whole area of _terra firma_ is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.
LANGUAGE, n.  The music with which we charm the serpents guarding another's treasure.
LAOCOON, n.  A famous piece of antique scripture representing a priest of that name and his two sons in the folds of two enormous serpents. The skill and diligence with which the old man and lads support the serpents and keep them up to their work have been justly regarded as one of the noblest artistic illustrations of the mastery of human intelligence over brute inertia.
LAP, n.  One of the most important organs of the female system—an admirable provision of nature for the repose of infancy, but chiefly useful in rural festivities to support plates of cold chicken and heads of adult males.  The male of our species has a rudimentary lap, imperfectly developed and in no way contributing to the animal's substantial welfare.
LAST, n.  A shoemaker's implement, named by a frowning Providence as opportunity to the maker of puns.
LAUGHTER, n.  An interior convulsion, producing a distortion of the features and accompanied by inarticulate noises.  It is infectious and, though intermittent, incurable.  Liability to attacks of laughter is one of the characteristics distinguishing man from the animals— these being not only inaccessible to the provocation of his example, but impregnable to the microbes having original jurisdiction in bestowal of the disease.  Whether laughter could be imparted to animals by inoculation from the human patient is a question that has not been answered by experimentation.  Dr. Meir Witchell holds that the infection character of laughter is due to the instantaneous fermentation of _sputa_ diffused in a spray.  From this peculiarity he names the disorder _Convulsio spargens_.
LAUREATE, adj.  Crowned with leaves of the laurel.  In England the Poet Laureate is an officer of the sovereign's court, acting as dancing skeleton at every royal feast and singing-mute at every royal funeral.  Of all incumbents of that high office, Robert Southey had the most notable knack at drugging the Samson of public joy and cutting his hair to the quick; and he had an artistic color-sense which enabled him so to blacken a public grief as to give it the aspect of a national crime.
LAUREL, n.  The _laurus_, a vegetable dedicated to Apollo, and formerly defoliated to wreathe the brows of victors and such poets as had influence at court.  (_Vide supra._)
LAWFUL, adj.  Compatible with the will of a judge having jurisdiction.
LAWYER, n.  One skilled in circumvention of the law.
LAZINESS, n.  Unwarranted repose of manner in a person of low degree.
LEAD, n.  A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to light lovers—particularly to those who love not wisely but other men's wives.  Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an argument of such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong way.  An interesting fact in the chemistry of international controversy is that at the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is precipitated in great quantities.
LEARNING, n.  The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious.
LECTURER, n.  One with his hand in your pocket, his tongue in your ear and his faith in your patience.
LEGACY, n.  A gift from one who is legging it out of this vale of tears.
LEONINE, adj.  Unlike a menagerie lion.  Leonine verses are those in which a word in the middle of a line rhymes with a word at the end, as in this famous passage from Bella Peeler Silcox:
LETTUCE, n.  An herb of the genus _Lactuca_, "Wherewith," says that pious gastronome, Hengist Pelly, "God has been pleased to reward the good and punish the wicked.  For by his inner light the righteous man has discerned a manner of compounding for it a dressing to the appetency whereof a multitude of gustible condiments conspire, being reconciled and ameliorated with profusion of oil, the entire comestible making glad the heart of the godly and causing his face to shine.  But the person of spiritual unworth is successfully tempted to the Adversary to eat of lettuce with destitution of oil, mustard, egg, salt and garlic, and with a rascal bath of vinegar polluted with sugar.  Wherefore the person of spiritual unworth suffers an intestinal pang of strange complexity and raises the song."
LEVIATHAN, n.  An enormous aquatic animal mentioned by Job.  Some suppose it to have been the whale, but that distinguished ichthyologer, Dr. Jordan, of Stanford University, maintains with considerable heat that it was a species of gigantic Tadpole (_Thaddeus Polandensis_) or Polliwig—_Maria pseudo-hirsuta_.  For an exhaustive description and history of the Tadpole consult the famous monograph of Jane Potter, _Thaddeus of Warsaw_.
LEXICOGRAPHER, n.  A pestilent fellow who, under the pretense of recording some particular stage in the development of a language, does what he can to arrest its growth, stiffen its flexibility and mechanize its methods.  For your lexicographer, having written his dictionary, comes to be considered "as one having authority," whereas his function is only to make a record, not to give a law.  The natural servility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial power, surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statue.  Let the dictionary (for example) mark a good word as "obsolete" or "obsolescent" and few men thereafter venture to use it, whatever their need of it and however desirable its restoration to favor—whereby the process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays.  On the contrary, recognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if it grow at all, makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense, has no following and is tartly reminded that "it isn't in the dictionary" —although down to the time of the first lexicographer (Heaven forgive him!) no author ever had used a word that _was_ in the dictionary.  In the golden prime and high noon of English speech; when from the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own meaning and carried it in their very sound; when a Shakespeare and a Bacon were possible, and the language now rapidly perishing at one end and slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy preservation—sweeter than honey and stronger than a lion—the lexicographer was a person unknown, the dictionary a creation which his Creator had not created him to create.
LIAR, n.  A lawyer with a roving commission.
LIBERTY, n.  One of Imagination's most precious possessions.
LICKSPITTLE, n.  A useful functionary, not infrequently found editing a newspaper.  In his character of editor he is closely allied to the blackmailer by the tie of occasional identity; for in truth the lickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect, although the latter is frequently found as an independent species.  Lickspittling is more detestable than blackmailing, precisely as the business of a confidence man is more detestable than that of a highway robber; and the parallel maintains itself throughout, for whereas few robbers will cheat, every sneak will plunder if he dare.
LIFE, n.  A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay.  We live in daily apprehension of its loss; yet when lost it is not missed. The question, "Is life worth living?" has been much discussed; particularly by those who think it is not, many of whom have written at great length in support of their view and by careful observance of the laws of health enjoyed for long terms of years the honors of successful controversy.
LIGHTHOUSE, n.  A tall building on the seashore in which the government maintains a lamp and the friend of a politician.
LIMB, n.  The branch of a tree or the leg of an American woman.
LINEN, n.  "A kind of cloth the making of which, when made of hemp, entails a great waste of hemp."—Calcraft the Hangman.
LITIGANT, n.  A person about to give up his skin for the hope of retaining his bones.
LITIGATION, n.  A machine which you go into as a pig and come out of as a sausage.
LIVER, n.  A large red organ thoughtfully provided by nature to be bilious with.  The sentiments and emotions which every literary anatomist now knows to haunt the heart were anciently believed to infest the liver; and even Gascoygne, speaking of the emotional side of human nature, calls it "our hepaticall parte."  It was at one time considered the seat of life; hence its name—liver, the thing we live with.  The liver is heaven's best gift to the goose; without it that bird would be unable to supply us with the Strasbourg _pate_.
LOCK-AND-KEY, n.  The distinguishing device of civilization and enlightenment.
LODGER, n.  A less popular name for the Second Person of that delectable newspaper Trinity, the Roomer, the Bedder, and the Mealer.
LOGIC, n.  The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding.  The basic of logic is the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor premise and a conclusion—thus:
LOGOMACHY, n.  A war in which the weapons are words and the wounds punctures in the swim-bladder of self-esteem—a kind of contest in which, the vanquished being unconscious of defeat, the victor is denied the reward of success.
LONGANIMITY, n.  The disposition to endure injury with meek forbearance while maturing a plan of revenge.
LONGEVITY, n.  Uncommon extension of the fear of death.
LOOKING-GLASS, n.  A vitreous plane upon which to display a fleeting show for man's disillusion given.
LOQUACITY, n.  A disorder which renders the sufferer unable to curb his tongue when you wish to talk.
LORD, n.  In American society, an English tourist above the state of a costermonger, as, lord 'Aberdasher, Lord Hartisan and so forth.  The traveling Briton of lesser degree is addressed as "Sir," as, Sir 'Arry Donkiboi, or 'Amstead 'Eath.  The word "Lord" is sometimes used, also, as a title of the Supreme Being; but this is thought to be rather flattery than true reverence.
LORE, n.  Learning—particularly that sort which is not derived from a regular course of instruction but comes of the reading of occult books, or by nature.  This latter is commonly designated as folk-lore and embraces popularly myths and superstitions.  In Baring-Gould's _Curious Myths of the Middle Ages_ the reader will find many of these traced backward, through various people son converging lines, toward a common origin in remote antiquity.  Among these are the fables of "Teddy the Giant Killer," "The Sleeping John Sharp Williams," "Little Red Riding Hood and the Sugar Trust," "Beauty and the Brisbane," "The Seven Aldermen of Ephesus," "Rip Van Fairbanks," and so forth.  The fable with Goethe so affectingly relates under the title of "The Erl-King" was known two thousand years ago in Greece as "The Demos and the Infant Industry."  One of the most general and ancient of these myths is that Arabian tale of "Ali Baba and the Forty Rockefellers."
LOSS, n.  Privation of that which we had, or had not.  Thus, in the latter sense, it is said of a defeated candidate that he "lost his election"; and of that eminent man, the poet Gilder, that he has "lost his mind."  It is in the former and more legitimate sense, that the word is used in the famous epitaph:
LOVE, n.  A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder. This disease, like _caries_ and many other ailments, is prevalent only among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its ravages.  It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the physician than to the patient.
LOW-BRED, adj.  "Raised" instead of brought up.
LUMINARY, n.  One who throws light upon a subject; as an editor by not writing about it.
LUNARIAN, n.  An inhabitant of the moon, as distinguished from Lunatic, one whom the moon inhabits.  The Lunarians have been described by Lucian, Locke and other observers, but without much agreement.  For example, Bragellos avers their anatomical identity with Man, but Professor Newcomb says they are more like the hill tribes of Vermont.
LYRE, n.  An ancient instrument of torture.  The word is now used in a figurative sense to denote the poetic faculty, as in the following fiery lines of our great poet, Ella Wheeler Wilcox:
MACE, n.  A staff of office signifying authority.  Its form, that of a heavy club, indicates its original purpose and use in dissuading from dissent.
MACHINATION, n.  The method employed by one's opponents in baffling one's open and honorable efforts to do the right thing.
MACROBIAN, n.  One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known.  A Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging.  In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity (_macrobiosis_) in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better.  The editor of _The American_, a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact.  The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit.  The verses following were written by a macrobian:
MAD, adj.  Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; not conforming to standards of thought, speech and action derived by the conformants from study of themselves; at odds with the majority; in short, unusual.  It is noteworthy that persons are pronounced mad by officials destitute of evidence that themselves are sane.  For illustration, this present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no firmer in the faith of his own sanity than is any inmate of any madhouse in the land; yet for aught he knows to the contrary, instead of the lofty occupation that seems to him to be engaging his powers he may really be beating his hands against the window bars of an asylum and declaring himself Noah Webster, to the innocent delight of many thoughtless spectators.
MAGDALENE, n.  An inhabitant of Magdala.  Popularly, a woman found out.  This definition of the word has the authority of ignorance, Mary of Magdala being another person than the penitent woman mentioned by St. Luke.  It has also the official sanction of the governments of Great Britain and the United States.  In England the word is pronounced Maudlin, whence maudlin, adjective, unpleasantly sentimental.  With their Maudlin for Magdalene, and their Bedlam for Bethlehem, the English may justly boast themselves the greatest of revisers.
MAGIC, n.  An art of converting superstition into coin.  There are other arts serving the same high purpose, but the discreet lexicographer does not name them.
MAGNET, n.  Something acted upon by magnetism.
MAGNETISM, n.  Something acting upon a magnet.
MAGNIFICENT, adj.  Having a grandeur or splendor superior to that to which the spectator is accustomed, as the ears of an ass, to a rabbit, or the glory of a glowworm, to a maggot.
MAGNITUDE, n.  Size.  Magnitude being purely relative, nothing is large and nothing small.  If everything in the universe were increased in bulk one thousand diameters nothing would be any larger than it was before, but if one thing remain unchanged all the others would be larger than they had been.  To an understanding familiar with the relativity of magnitude and distance the spaces and masses of the astronomer would be no more impressive than those of the microscopist. For anything we know to the contrary, the visible universe may be a small part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life-fluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal.  Possibly the wee creatures peopling the corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper emotion when contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these to another.
MAGPIE, n.  A bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone that it might be taught to talk.
MAIDEN, n.  A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless conduct and views that madden to crime.  The genus has a wide geographical distribution, being found wherever sought and deplored wherever found.  The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye, nor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear, though in respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with regard to the part of her that is audible, bleating out of the field by the canary—which, also, is more portable.
MAJESTY, n.  The state and title of a king.  Regarded with a just contempt by the Most Eminent Grand Masters, Grand Chancellors, Great Incohonees and Imperial Potentates of the ancient and honorable orders of republican America.
MALE, n.  A member of the unconsidered, or negligible sex.  The male of the human race is commonly known (to the female) as Mere Man.  The genus has two varieties:  good providers and bad providers.
MALEFACTOR, n.  The chief factor in the progress of the human race.
MALTHUSIAN, adj.  Pertaining to Malthus and his doctrines.  Malthus believed in artificially limiting population, but found that it could not be done by talking.  One of the most practical exponents of the Malthusian idea was Herod of Judea, though all the famous soldiers have been of the same way of thinking.
MAMMALIA, n.pl.  A family of vertebrate animals whose females in a state of nature suckle their young, but when civilized and enlightened put them out to nurse, or use the bottle.
MAMMON, n.  The god of the world's leading religion.  The chief temple is in the holy city of New York.
MAN, n.  An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he thinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be.  His chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to infest the whole habitable earth and Canada.
MANES, n.  The immortal parts of dead Greeks and Romans.  They were in a state of dull discomfort until the bodies from which they had exhaled were buried and burned; and they seem not to have been particularly happy afterward.
MANICHEISM, n.  The ancient Persian doctrine of an incessant warfare between Good and Evil.  When Good gave up the fight the Persians joined the victorious Opposition.
MANNA, n.  A food miraculously given to the Israelites in the wilderness.  When it was no longer supplied to them they settled down and tilled the soil, fertilizing it, as a rule, with the bodies of the original occupants.
MARRIAGE, n.  The state or condition of a community consisting of a master, a mistress and two slaves, making in all, two.
MARTYR, n.  One who moves along the line of least reluctance to a desired death.
MATERIAL, adj.  Having an actual existence, as distinguished from an imaginary one.  Important.
MAUSOLEUM, n.  The final and funniest folly of the rich.
MAYONNAISE, n.  One of the sauces which serve the French in place of a state religion.
ME, pro.  The objectionable case of I.  The personal pronoun in English has three cases, the dominative, the objectionable and the oppressive.  Each is all three.
MEANDER, n.  To proceed sinuously and aimlessly.  The word is the ancient name of a river about one hundred and fifty miles south of Troy, which turned and twisted in the effort to get out of hearing when the Greeks and Trojans boasted of their prowess.
MEDAL, n.  A small metal disk given as a reward for virtues, attainments or services more or less authentic.
MEDICINE, n.  A stone flung down the Bowery to kill a dog in Broadway.
MEEKNESS, n.  Uncommon patience in planning a revenge that is worth while.
MEERSCHAUM, n.  (Literally, seafoam, and by many erroneously supposed to be made of it.)  A fine white clay, which for convenience in coloring it brown is made into tobacco pipes and smoked by the workmen engaged in that industry.  The purpose of coloring it has not been disclosed by the manufacturers.
MENDACIOUS, adj.  Addicted to rhetoric.
MERCHANT, n.  One engaged in a commercial pursuit.  A commercial pursuit is one in which the thing pursued is a dollar.
MERCY, n.  An attribute beloved of detected offenders.
MESMERISM, n.  Hypnotism before it wore good clothes, kept a carriage and asked Incredulity to dinner.
METROPOLIS, n.  A stronghold of provincialism.
MILLENNIUM, n.  The period of a thousand years when the lid is to be screwed down, with all reformers on the under side.
MIND, n.  A mysterious form of matter secreted by the brain.  Its chief activity consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing but itself to know itself with.  From the Latin _mens_, a fact unknown to that honest shoe-seller, who, observing that his learned competitor over the way had displayed the motto "_Mens conscia recti_," emblazoned his own front with the words "Men's, women's and children's conscia recti."
MINE, adj.  Belonging to me if I can hold or seize it.
MINISTER, n.  An agent of a higher power with a lower responsibility. In diplomacy and officer sent into a foreign country as the visible embodiment of his sovereign's hostility.  His principal qualification is a degree of plausible inveracity next below that of an ambassador.
MINOR, adj.  Less objectionable.
MINSTREL, adj.  Formerly a poet, singer or musician; now a nigger with a color less than skin deep and a humor more than flesh and blood can bear.
MIRACLE, n.  An act or event out of the order of nature and unaccountable, as beating a normal hand of four kings and an ace with four aces and a king.
MISCREANT, n.  A person of the highest degree of unworth. Etymologically, the word means unbeliever, and its present signification may be regarded as theology's noblest contribution to the development of our language.
MISDEMEANOR, n.  An infraction of the law having less dignity than a felony and constituting no claim to admittance into the best criminal society.
MISERICORDE, n.  A dagger which in mediaeval warfare was used by the foot soldier to remind an unhorsed knight that he was mortal.
MISFORTUNE, n.  The kind of fortune that never misses.
MISS, n.  The title with which we brand unmarried women to indicate that they are in the market.  Miss, Missis (Mrs.) and Mister (Mr.) are the three most distinctly disagreeable words in the language, in sound and sense.  Two are corruptions of Mistress, the other of Master.  In the general abolition of social titles in this our country they miraculously escaped to plague us.  If we must have them let us be consistent and give one to the unmarried man.  I venture to suggest Mush, abbreviated to Mh.
MOLECULE, n.  The ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  It is distinguished from the corpuscle, also the ultimate, indivisible unit of matter, by a closer resemblance to the atom, also the ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  Three great scientific theories of the structure of the universe are the molecular, the corpuscular and the atomic.  A fourth affirms, with Haeckel, the condensation of precipitation of matter from ether—whose existence is proved by the condensation of precipitation.  The present trend of scientific thought is toward the theory of ions.  The ion differs from the molecule, the corpuscle and the atom in that it is an ion.  A fifth theory is held by idiots, but it is doubtful if they know any more about the matter than the others.
MONAD, n.  The ultimate, indivisible unit of matter.  (See _Molecule_.)  According to Leibnitz, as nearly as he seems willing to be understood, the monad has body without bulk, and mind without manifestation—Leibnitz knows him by the innate power of considering.  He has founded upon him a theory of the universe, which the creature bears without resentment, for the monad is a gentleman. Small as he is, the monad contains all the powers and possibilities needful to his evolution into a German philosopher of the first class —altogether a very capable little fellow.  He is not to be confounded with the microbe, or bacillus; by its inability to discern him, a good microscope shows him to be of an entirely distinct species.
MONARCH, n.  A person engaged in reigning.  Formerly the monarch ruled, as the derivation of the word attests, and as many subjects have had occasion to learn.  In Russia and the Orient the monarch has still a considerable influence in public affairs and in the disposition of the human head, but in western Europe political administration is mostly entrusted to his ministers, he being somewhat preoccupied with reflections relating to the status of his own head.
MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT, n.  Government.
MONDAY, n.  In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.
MONEY, n.  A blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we part with it.  An evidence of culture and a passport to polite society.  Supportable property.
MONKEY, n.  An arboreal animal which makes itself at home in genealogical trees.
MONOSYLLABIC, adj.  Composed of words of one syllable, for literary babes who never tire of testifying their delight in the vapid compound by appropriate googoogling.  The words are commonly Saxon—that is to say, words of a barbarous people destitute of ideas and incapable of any but the most elementary sentiments and emotions.
MONSIGNOR, n.  A high ecclesiastical title, of which the Founder of our religion overlooked the advantages.
MONUMENT, n.  A structure intended to commemorate something which either needs no commemoration or cannot be commemorated.
MORAL, adj.  Conforming to a local and mutable standard of right. Having the quality of general expediency.
MORE, adj.  The comparative degree of too much.
MOUSE, n.  An animal which strews its path with fainting women.  As in Rome Christians were thrown to the lions, so centuries earlier in Otumwee, the most ancient and famous city of the world, female heretics were thrown to the mice.  Jakak-Zotp, the historian, the only Otumwump whose writings have descended to us, says that these martyrs met their death with little dignity and much exertion.  He even attempts to exculpate the mice (such is the malice of bigotry) by declaring that the unfortunate women perished, some from exhaustion, some of broken necks from falling over their own feet, and some from lack of restoratives.  The mice, he avers, enjoyed the pleasures of the chase with composure.  But if "Roman history is nine-tenths lying," we can hardly expect a smaller proportion of that rhetorical figure in the annals of a people capable of so incredible cruelty to a lovely women; for a hard heart has a false tongue.
MOUSQUETAIRE, n.  A long glove covering a part of the arm.  Worn in New Jersey.  But "mousquetaire" is a might poor way to spell muskeeter.
MOUTH, n.  In man, the gateway to the soul; in woman, the outlet of the heart.
MUGWUMP, n.  In politics one afflicted with self-respect and addicted to the vice of independence.  A term of contempt.
MULATTO, n.  A child of two races, ashamed of both.
MULTITUDE, n.  A crowd; the source of political wisdom and virtue.  In a republic, the object of the statesman's adoration.  "In a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom," saith the proverb.  If many men of equal individual wisdom are wiser than any one of them, it must be that they acquire the excess of wisdom by the mere act of getting together.  Whence comes it?  Obviously from nowhere—as well say that a range of mountains is higher than the single mountains composing it.  A multitude is as wise as its wisest member if it obey him; if not, it is no wiser than its most foolish.
MUMMY, n.  An ancient Egyptian, formerly in universal use among modern civilized nations as medicine, and now engaged in supplying art with an excellent pigment.  He is handy, too, in museums in gratifying the vulgar curiosity that serves to distinguish man from the lower animals.
MUSTANG, n.  An indocile horse of the western plains.  In English society, the American wife of an English nobleman.
MYRMIDON, n.  A follower of Achilles—particularly when he didn't lead.
MYTHOLOGY, n.  The body of a primitive people's beliefs concerning its origin, early history, heroes, deities and so forth, as distinguished from the true accounts which it invents later.
NECTAR, n.  A drink served at banquets of the Olympian deities.  The secret of its preparation is lost, but the modern Kentuckians believe that they come pretty near to a knowledge of its chief ingredient.
NEGRO, n.  The _piece de resistance_ in the American political problem.  Representing him by the letter n, the Republicans begin to build their equation thus:  "Let n = the white man."  This, however, appears to give an unsatisfactory solution.
NEIGHBOR, n.  One whom we are commanded to love as ourselves, and who does all he knows how to make us disobedient.
NEPOTISM, n.  Appointing your grandmother to office for the good of the party.
NEWTONIAN, adj.  Pertaining to a philosophy of the universe invented by Newton, who discovered that an apple will fall to the ground, but was unable to say why.  His successors and disciples have advanced so far as to be able to say when.
NIHILIST, n.  A Russian who denies the existence of anything but Tolstoi.  The leader of the school is Tolstoi.
NIRVANA, n.  In the Buddhist religion, a state of pleasurable annihilation awarded to the wise, particularly to those wise enough to understand it.
NOBLEMAN, n.  Nature's provision for wealthy American minds ambitious to incur social distinction and suffer high life.
NOISE, n.  A stench in the ear.  Undomesticated music.  The chief product and authenticating sign of civilization.
NOMINATE, v.  To designate for the heaviest political assessment.  To put forward a suitable person to incur the mudgobbling and deadcatting of the opposition.
NOMINEE, n.  A modest gentleman shrinking from the distinction of private life and diligently seeking the honorable obscurity of public office.
NON-COMBATANT, n.  A dead Quaker.
NONSENSE, n.  The objections that are urged against this excellent dictionary.
NOSE, n.  The extreme outpost of the face.  From the circumstance that great conquerors have great noses, Getius, whose writings antedate the age of humor, calls the nose the organ of quell.  It has been observed that one's nose is never so happy as when thrust into the affairs of others, from which some physiologists have drawn the inference that the nose is devoid of the sense of smell.
NOTORIETY, n.  The fame of one's competitor for public honors.  The kind of renown most accessible and acceptable to mediocrity.  A Jacob's-ladder leading to the vaudeville stage, with angels ascending and descending.
NOUMENON, n.  That which exists, as distinguished from that which merely seems to exist, the latter being a phenomenon.  The noumenon is a bit difficult to locate; it can be apprehended only be a process of reasoning—which is a phenomenon.  Nevertheless, the discovery and exposition of noumena offer a rich field for what Lewes calls "the endless variety and excitement of philosophic thought."  Hurrah (therefore) for the noumenon!
NOVEL, n.  A short story padded.  A species of composition bearing the same relation to literature that the panorama bears to art.  As it is too long to be read at a sitting the impressions made by its successive parts are successively effaced, as in the panorama.  Unity, totality of effect, is impossible; for besides the few pages last read all that is carried in mind is the mere plot of what has gone before. To the romance the novel is what photography is to painting.  Its distinguishing principle, probability, corresponds to the literal actuality of the photograph and puts it distinctly into the category of reporting; whereas the free wing of the romancer enables him to mount to such altitudes of imagination as he may be fitted to attain; and the first three essentials of the literary art are imagination, imagination and imagination.  The art of writing novels, such as it was, is long dead everywhere except in Russia, where it is new.  Peace to its ashes—some of which have a large sale.
NOVEMBER, n.  The eleventh twelfth of a weariness.
OATH, n.  In law, a solemn appeal to the Deity, made binding upon the conscience by a penalty for perjury.
OBLIVION, n.  The state or condition in which the wicked cease from struggling and the dreary are at rest.  Fame's eternal dumping ground. Cold storage for high hopes.  A place where ambitious authors meet their works without pride and their betters without envy.  A dormitory without an alarm clock.
OBSERVATORY, n.  A place where astronomers conjecture away the guesses of their predecessors.
OBSESSED, p.p.  Vexed by an evil spirit, like the Gadarene swine and other critics.  Obsession was once more common than it is now. Arasthus tells of a peasant who was occupied by a different devil for every day in the week, and on Sundays by two.  They were frequently seen, always walking in his shadow, when he had one, but were finally driven away by the village notary, a holy man; but they took the peasant with them, for he vanished utterly.  A devil thrown out of a woman by the Archbishop of Rheims ran through the trees, pursued by a hundred persons, until the open country was reached, where by a leap higher than a church spire he escaped into a bird.  A chaplain in Cromwell's army exorcised a soldier's obsessing devil by throwing the soldier into the water, when the devil came to the surface.  The soldier, unfortunately, did not.
OBSOLETE, adj.  No longer used by the timid.  Said chiefly of words. A word which some lexicographer has marked obsolete is ever thereafter an object of dread and loathing to the fool writer, but if it is a good word and has no exact modern equivalent equally good, it is good enough for the good writer.  Indeed, a writer's attitude toward "obsolete" words is as true a measure of his literary ability as anything except the character of his work.  A dictionary of obsolete and obsolescent words would not only be singularly rich in strong and sweet parts of speech; it would add large possessions to the vocabulary of every competent writer who might not happen to be a competent reader.
OBSTINATE, adj.  Inaccessible to the truth as it is manifest in the splendor and stress of our advocacy.
OCCASIONAL, adj.  Afflicting us with greater or less frequency.  That, however, is not the sense in which the word is used in the phrase "occasional verses," which are verses written for an "occasion," such as an anniversary, a celebration or other event.  True, they afflict us a little worse than other sorts of verse, but their name has no reference to irregular recurrence.
OCCIDENT, n.  The part of the world lying west (or east) of the Orient.  It is largely inhabited by Christians, a powerful subtribe of the Hypocrites, whose principal industries are murder and cheating, which they are pleased to call "war" and "commerce."  These, also, are the principal industries of the Orient.
OCEAN, n.  A body of water occupying about two-thirds of a world made for man—who has no gills.
OFFENSIVE, adj.  Generating disagreeable emotions or sensations, as the advance of an army against its enemy.
OLD, adj.  In that stage of usefulness which is not inconsistent with general inefficiency, as an _old man_.  Discredited by lapse of time and offensive to the popular taste, as an _old_ book.
OLEAGINOUS, adj.  Oily, smooth, sleek.
OLYMPIAN, adj.  Relating to a mountain in Thessaly, once inhabited by gods, now a repository of yellowing newspapers, beer bottles and mutilated sardine cans, attesting the presence of the tourist and his appetite.
OMEN, n.  A sign that something will happen if nothing happens.
ONCE, adv.  Enough.
OPERA, n.  A play representing life in another world, whose inhabitants have no speech but song, no motions but gestures and no postures but attitudes.  All acting is simulation, and the word _simulation_ is from _simia_, an ape; but in opera the actor takes for his model _Simia audibilis_ (or _Pithecanthropos stentor_)—the ape that howls.
OPIATE, n.  An unlocked door in the prison of Identity.  It leads into the jail yard.
OPPORTUNITY, n.  A favorable occasion for grasping a disappointment.
OPPOSE, v.  To assist with obstructions and objections.
OPPOSITION, n.  In politics the party that prevents the Government from running amuck by hamstringing it.
OPTIMISM, n.  The doctrine, or belief, that everything is beautiful, including what is ugly, everything good, especially the bad, and everything right that is wrong.  It is held with greatest tenacity by those most accustomed to the mischance of falling into adversity, and is most acceptably expounded with the grin that apes a smile.  Being a blind faith, it is inaccessible to the light of disproof—an intellectual disorder, yielding to no treatment but death.  It is hereditary, but fortunately not contagious.
OPTIMIST, n.  A proponent of the doctrine that black is white.
ORATORY, n.  A conspiracy between speech and action to cheat the understanding.  A tyranny tempered by stenography.
ORPHAN, n.  A living person whom death has deprived of the power of filial ingratitude—a privation appealing with a particular eloquence to all that is sympathetic in human nature.  When young the orphan is commonly sent to an asylum, where by careful cultivation of its rudimentary sense of locality it is taught to know its place.  It is then instructed in the arts of dependence and servitude and eventually turned loose to prey upon the world as a bootblack or scullery maid.
ORTHODOX, n.  An ox wearing the popular religious joke.
ORTHOGRAPHY, n.  The science of spelling by the eye instead of the ear.  Advocated with more heat than light by the outmates of every asylum for the insane.  They have had to concede a few things since the time of Chaucer, but are none the less hot in defence of those to be conceded hereafter.
OSTRICH, n.  A large bird to which (for its sins, doubtless) nature has denied that hinder toe in which so many pious naturalists have seen a conspicuous evidence of design.  The absence of a good working pair of wings is no defect, for, as has been ingeniously pointed out, the ostrich does not fly.
OTHERWISE, adv.  No better.
OUTCOME, n.  A particular type of disappointment.  By the kind of intelligence that sees in an exception a proof of the rule the wisdom of an act is judged by the outcome, the result.  This is immortal nonsense; the wisdom of an act is to be juded by the light that the doer had when he performed it.
OUTDO, v.t.  To make an enemy.
OUT-OF-DOORS, n.  That part of one's environment upon which no government has been able to collect taxes.  Chiefly useful to inspire poets.
OVATION, n.  n ancient Rome, a definite, formal pageant in honor of one who had been disserviceable to the enemies of the nation.  A lesser "triumph."  In modern English the word is improperly used to signify any loose and spontaneous expression of popular homage to the hero of the hour and place.
OVEREAT, v.  To dine.
OVERWORK, n.  A dangerous disorder affecting high public functionaries who want to go fishing.
OWE, v.  To have (and to hold) a debt.  The word formerly signified not indebtedness, but possession; it meant "own," and in the minds of debtors there is still a good deal of confusion between assets and liabilities.
OYSTER, n.  A slimy, gobby shellfish which civilization gives men the hardihood to eat without removing its entrails!  The shells are sometimes given to the poor.

PAINTING, n.  The art of protecting flat surfaces from the weather and exposing them to the critic.
PALACE, n.  A fine and costly residence, particularly that of a great official.  The residence of a high dignitary of the Christian Church is called a palace; that of the Founder of his religion was known as a field, or wayside.  There is progress.
PALM, n.  A species of tree having several varieties, of which the familiar "itching palm" (_Palma hominis_) is most widely distributed and sedulously cultivated.  This noble vegetable exudes a kind of invisible gum, which may be detected by applying to the bark a piece of gold or silver.  The metal will adhere with remarkable tenacity. The fruit of the itching palm is so bitter and unsatisfying that a considerable percentage of it is sometimes given away in what are known as "benefactions."
PALMISTRY, n.  The 947th method (according to Mimbleshaw's classification) of obtaining money by false pretences.  It consists in "reading character" in the wrinkles made by closing the hand.  The pretence is not altogether false; character can really be read very accurately in this way, for the wrinkles in every hand submitted plainly spell the word "dupe."  The imposture consists in not reading it aloud.
PANDEMONIUM, n.  Literally, the Place of All the Demons.  Most of them have escaped into politics and finance, and the place is now used as a lecture hall by the Audible Reformer.  When disturbed by his voice the ancient echoes clamor appropriate responses most gratifying to his pride of distinction.
PANTALOONS, n.  A nether habiliment of the adult civilized male.  The garment is tubular and unprovided with hinges at the points of flexion.  Supposed to have been invented by a humorist.  Called "trousers" by the enlightened and "pants" by the unworthy.

PASSPORT, n.  A document treacherously inflicted upon a citizen going abroad, exposing him as an alien and pointing him out for special reprobation and outrage.
PAST, n.  That part of Eternity with some small fraction of which we have a slight and regrettable acquaintance.  A moving line called the Present parts it from an imaginary period known as the Future.  These two grand divisions of Eternity, of which the one is continually effacing the other, are entirely unlike.  The one is dark with sorrow and disappointment, the other bright with prosperity and joy.  The Past is the region of sobs, the Future is the realm of song.  In the one crouches Memory, clad in sackcloth and ashes, mumbling penitential prayer; in the sunshine of the other Hope flies with a free wing, beckoning to temples of success and bowers of ease.  Yet the Past is the Future of yesterday, the Future is the Past of to-morrow.  They are one—the knowledge and the dream.
PASTIME, n.  A device for promoting dejection.  Gentle exercise for intellectual debility.

PERIPATETIC, adj.  Walking about.  Relating to the philosophy of Aristotle, who, while expounding it, moved from place to place in order to avoid his pupil's objections.  A needless precaution—they knew no more of the matter than he.
PERORATION, n.  The explosion of an oratorical rocket.  It dazzles, but to an observer having the wrong kind of nose its most conspicuous peculiarity is the smell of the several kinds of powder used in preparing it.
PERSEVERANCE, n.  A lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success.
PESSIMISM, n.  A philosophy forced upon the convictions of the observer by the disheartening prevalence of the optimist with his scarecrow hope and his unsightly smile.

PIETY, n.  Reverence for the Supreme Being, based upon His supposed resemblance to man.
PIG, n.  An animal (_Porcus omnivorus_) closely allied to the human race by the splendor and vivacity of its appetite, which, however, is inferior in scope, for it sticks at pig.
PIGMY, n.  One of a tribe of very small men found by ancient travelers in many parts of the world, but by modern in Central Africa only.  The Pigmies are so called to distinguish them from the bulkier Caucasians —who are Hogmies.
PILGRIM, n.  A traveler that is taken seriously.  A Pilgrim Father was one who, leaving Europe in 1620 because not permitted to sing psalms through his nose, followed it to Massachusetts, where he could personate God according to the dictates of his conscience.

PLATITUDE, n.  The fundamental element and special glory of popular literature. A thought that snores in words that smoke.  The wisdom of a million fools in the diction of a dullard.

POLYGAMY, n.  A house of atonement, or expiatory chapel, fitted with several stools of repentance, as distinguished from monogamy, which has but one.
POPULIST, n.  A fossil patriot of the early agricultural period, found in the old red soapstone underlying Kansas; characterized by an uncommon spread of ear, which some naturalists contend gave him the power of flight, though Professors Morse and Whitney, pursuing independent lines of thought, have ingeniously pointed out that had he possessed it he would have gone elsewhere.  In the picturesque speech of his period, some fragments of which have come down to us, he was known as "The Matter with Kansas."

POTABLE, n.  Suitable for drinking.  Water is said to be potable; indeed, some declare it our natural beverage, although even they find it palatable only when suffering from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it is a medicine.  Upon nothing has so great and diligent ingenuity been brought to bear in all ages and in all countries, except the most uncivilized, as upon the invention of substitutes for water.  To hold that this general aversion to that liquid has no basis in the preservative instinct of the race is to be unscientific—and without science we are as the snakes and toads.
POVERTY, n.  A file provided for the teeth of the rats of reform.  The number of plans for its abolition equals that of the reformers who suffer from it, plus that of the philosophers who know nothing about it.

PRAY, v.  To ask that the laws of the universe be annulled in behalf of a single petitioner confessedly unworthy.
PRE-ADAMITE, n.  One of an experimental and apparently unsatisfactory race of antedated Creation and lived under conditions not easily conceived.  Melsius believed them to have inhabited "the Void" and to have been something intermediate between fishes and birds.  Little its known of them beyond the fact that they supplied Cain with a wife and theologians with a controversy.
PRECEDENT, n.  In Law, a previous decision, rule or practice which, in the absence of a definite statute, has whatever force and authority a Judge may choose to give it, thereby greatly simplifying his task of doing as he pleases.  As there are precedents for everything, he has only to ignore those that make against his interest and accentuate those in the line of his desire.  Invention of the precedent elevates the trial-at-law from the low estate of a fortuitous ordeal to the noble attitude of a dirigible arbitrament.
PRECIPITATE, adj.  Anteprandial.
PREDESTINATION, n.  The doctrine that all things occur according to programme.  This doctrine should not be confused with that of foreordination, which means that all things are programmed, but does not affirm their occurrence, that being only an implication from other doctrines by which this is entailed.  The difference is great enough to have deluged Christendom with ink, to say nothing of the gore. With the distinction of the two doctrines kept well in mind, and a reverent belief in both, one may hope to escape perdition if spared.
PREDICAMENT, n.  The wage of consistency.

PRIVATE, n.  A military gentleman with a field-marshal's baton in his knapsack and an impediment in his hope.

PROJECTILE, n.  The final arbiter in international disputes.  Formerly these disputes were settled by physical contact of the disputants, with such simple arguments as the rudimentary logic of the times could supply—the sword, the spear, and so forth.  With the growth of prudence in military affairs the projectile came more and more into favor, and is now held in high esteem by the most courageous.  Its capital defect is that it requires personal attendance at the point of propulsion.
PROOF, n.  Evidence having a shade more of plausibility than of unlikelihood.  The testimony of two credible witnesses as opposed to that of only one.
PROOF-READER, n.  A malefactor who atones for making your writing nonsense by permitting the compositor to make it unintelligible.

QUIVER, n.  A portable sheath in which the ancient statesman and the aboriginal lawyer carried their lighter arguments.
QUIXOTIC, adj.  Absurdly chivalric, like Don Quixote.  An insight into the beauty and excellence of this incomparable adjective is unhappily denied to him who has the misfortune to know that the gentleman's name is pronounced Ke-ho-tay.
QUORUM, n.  A sufficient number of members of a deliberative body to have their own way and their own way of having it.  In the United States Senate a quorum consists of the chairman of the Committee on Finance and a messenger from the White House; in the House of Representatives, of the Speaker and the devil.
QUOTATION, n.  The act of repeating erroneously the words of another. The words erroneously repeated.
QUOTIENT, n.  A number showing how many times a sum of money belonging to one person is contained in the pocket of another—usually about as many times as it can be got there.
RABBLE, n.  In a republic, those who exercise a supreme authority tempered by fraudulent elections.  The rabble is like the sacred Simurgh, of Arabian fable—omnipotent on condition that it do nothing.  (The word is Aristocratese, and has no exact equivalent in our tongue, but means, as nearly as may be, "soaring swine.")
RACK, n.  An argumentative implement formerly much used in persuading devotees of a false faith to embrace the living truth.  As a call to the unconverted the rack never had any particular efficacy, and is now held in light popular esteem.

RAMSHACKLE, adj.  Pertaining to a certain order of architecture, otherwise known as the Normal American.  Most of the public buildings of the United States are of the Ramshackle order, though some of our earlier architects preferred the Ironic.  Recent additions to the White House in Washington are Theo-Doric, the ecclesiastic order of the Dorians.  They are exceedingly fine and cost one hundred dollars a brick.

REFUGE, n.  Anything assuring protection to one in peril.  Moses and Joshua provided six cities of refuge—Bezer, Golan, Ramoth, Kadesh, Schekem and Hebron—to which one who had taken life inadvertently could flee when hunted by relatives of the deceased.  This admirable expedient supplied him with wholesome exercise and enabled them to enjoy the pleasures of the chase; whereby the soul of the dead man was appropriately honored by observations akin to the funeral games of early Greece.
REFUSAL, n.  Denial of something desired; as an elderly maiden's hand in marriage, to a rich and handsome suitor; a valuable franchise to a rich corporation, by an alderman; absolution to an impenitent king, by a priest, and so forth.

The last is called by some casuists the refusal assentive.

Distinguishing insignia, jewels and costume of such ancient and honorable orders as Knights of Adam; Visionaries of Detectable Bosh; the Ancient Order of Modern Troglodytes; the League of Holy Humbug; the Golden Phalanx of Phalangers; the Genteel Society of Expurgated Hoodlums; the Mystic Alliances of Georgeous Regalians; Knights and Ladies of the Yellow Dog; the Oriental Order of Sons of the West; the Blatherhood of Insufferable Stuff; Warriors of the Long Bow; Guardians of the Great Horn Spoon; the Band of Brutes; the Impenitent Order of Wife-Beaters; the Sublime Legion of Flamboyant Conspicuants; Worshipers at the Electroplated Shrine; Shining Inaccessibles; Fee-Faw-Fummers of the inimitable Grip; Jannissaries of the Broad-Blown Peacock; Plumed Increscencies of the Magic Temple; the Grand Cabal of Able-Bodied Sedentarians; Associated Deities of the Butter Trade; the Garden of Galoots; the Affectionate Fraternity of Men Similarly Warted; the Flashing Astonishers; Ladies of Horror; Cooperative Association for Breaking into the Spotlight; Dukes of Eden; Disciples Militant of the Hidden Faith; Knights-Champions of the Domestic Dog; the Holy Gregarians; the Resolute Optimists; the Ancient Sodality of Inhospitable Hogs; Associated Sovereigns of Mendacity; Dukes-Guardian of the Mystic Cess-Pool; the Society for Prevention of Prevalence; Kings of Drink; Polite Federation of Gents-Consequential; the Mysterious Order of the Undecipherable Scroll; Uniformed Rank of Lousy Cats; Monarchs of Worth and Hunger; Sons of the South Star; Prelates of the Tub-and-Sword.

Reliquaries are commonly of metal, and provided with a lock to prevent the contents from coming out and performing miracles at unseasonable times.  A feather from the wing of the Angel of the Annunciation once escaped during a sermon in Saint Peter's and so tickled the noses of the congregation that they woke and sneezed with great vehemence three times each.  It is related in the "Gesta Sanctorum" that a sacristan in the Canterbury cathedral surprised the head of Saint Dennis in the library.  Reprimanded by its stern custodian, it explained that it was seeking a body of doctrine.  This unseemly levity so raged the diocesan that the offender was publicly anathematized, thrown into the Stour and replaced by another head of Saint Dennis, brought from Rome.

REPARTEE, n.  Prudent insult in retort.  Practiced by gentlemen with a constitutional aversion to violence, but a strong disposition to offend.  In a war of words, the tactics of the North American Indian.
REPENTANCE, n.  The faithful attendant and follower of Punishment.  It is usually manifest in a degree of reformation that is not inconsistent with continuity of sin.
REPLICA, n.  A reproduction of a work of art, by the artist that made the original.  It is so called to distinguish it from a "copy," which is made by another artist.  When the two are made with equal skill the replica is the more valuable, for it is supposed to be more beautiful than it looks.
REPORTER, n.  A writer who guesses his way to the truth and dispels it with a tempest of words.
REPOSE, v.i.  To cease from troubling.
REPRESENTATIVE, n.  In national politics, a member of the Lower House in this world, and without discernible hope of promotion in the next.

REPUBLIC, n.  A nation in which, the thing governing and the thing governed being the same, there is only a permitted authority to enforce an optional obedience.  In a republic, the foundation of public order is the ever lessening habit of submission inherited from ancestors who, being truly governed, submitted because they had to. There are as many kinds of republics as there are graduations between the despotism whence they came and the anarchy whither they lead.
REQUIEM, n.  A mass for the dead which the minor poets assure us the winds sing o'er the graves of their favorites.  Sometimes, by way of providing a varied entertainment, they sing a dirge.

RESOLUTE, adj.  Obstinate in a course that we approve.
RESPECTABILITY, n.  The offspring of a _liaison_ between a bald head and a bank account.
RESPIRATOR, n.  An apparatus fitted over the nose and mouth of an inhabitant of London, whereby to filter the visible universe in its passage to the lungs.
RESPITE, n.  A suspension of hostilities against a sentenced assassin, to enable the Executive to determine whether the murder may not have been done by the prosecuting attorney.  Any break in the continuity of a disagreeable expectation.
RESPLENDENT, adj.  Like a simple American citizen beduking himself in his lodge, or affirming his consequence in the Scheme of Things as an elemental unit of a parade.
RESPOND, v.i.  To make answer, or disclose otherwise a consciousness of having inspired an interest in what Herbert Spencer calls "external coexistences," as Satan "squat like a toad" at the ear of Eve, responded to the touch of the angel's spear.  To respond in damages is to contribute to the maintenance of the plaintiff's attorney and, incidentally, to the gratification of the plaintiff.
RESPONSIBILITY, n.  A detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one's neighbor.  In the days of astrology it was customary to unload it upon a star.
RESTITUTIONS, n.  The founding or endowing of universities and public libraries by gift or bequest.
RESTITUTOR, n.  Benefactor; philanthropist.
RETALIATION, n.  The natural rock upon which is reared the Temple of Law.
RETRIBUTION, n.  A rain of fire-and-brimstone that falls alike upon the just and such of the unjust as have not procured shelter by evicting them.
REVEILLE, n.  A signal to sleeping soldiers to dream of battlefields no more, but get up and have their blue noses counted.  In the American army it is ingeniously called "rev-e-lee," and to that pronunciation our countrymen have pledged their lives, their misfortunes and their sacred dishonor.
REVELATION, n.  A famous book in which St. John the Divine concealed all that he knew.  The revealing is done by the commentators, who know nothing.
REVERENCE, n.  The spiritual attitude of a man to a god and a dog to a man.
REVOLUTION, n.  In politics, an abrupt change in the form of misgovernment.  Specifically, in American history, the substitution of the rule of an Administration for that of a Ministry, whereby the welfare and happiness of the people were advanced a full half-inch. Revolutions are usually accompanied by a considerable effusion of blood, but are accounted worth it—this appraisement being made by beneficiaries whose blood had not the mischance to be shed.  The French revolution is of incalculable value to the Socialist of to-day; when he pulls the string actuating its bones its gestures are inexpressibly terrifying to gory tyrants suspected of fomenting law and order.
RHADOMANCER, n.  One who uses a divining-rod in prospecting for precious metals in the pocket of a fool.
RIBALDRY, n.  Censorious language by another concerning oneself.
RIBROASTER, n.  Censorious language by oneself concerning another. The word is of classical refinement, and is even said to have been used in a fable by Georgius Coadjutor, one of the most fastidious writers of the fifteenth century—commonly, indeed, regarded as the founder of the Fastidiotic School.
RICE-WATER, n.  A mystic beverage secretly used by our most popular novelists and poets to regulate the imagination and narcotize the conscience.  It is said to be rich in both obtundite and lethargine, and is brewed in a midnight fog by a fat which of the Dismal Swamp.
RICH, adj.  Holding in trust and subject to an accounting the property of the indolent, the incompetent, the unthrifty, the envious and the luckless.  That is the view that prevails in the underworld, where the Brotherhood of Man finds its most logical development and candid advocacy.  To denizens of the midworld the word means good and wise.
RIDICULE, n.  Words designed to show that the person of whom they are uttered is devoid of the dignity of character distinguishing him who utters them.  It may be graphic, mimetic or merely rident. Shaftesbury is quoted as having pronounced it the test of truth—a ridiculous assertion, for many a solemn fallacy has undergone centuries of ridicule with no abatement of its popular acceptance. What, for example, has been more valorously derided than the doctrine of Infant Respectability?
RIGHT, n.  Legitimate authority to be, to do or to have; as the right to be a king, the right to do one's neighbor, the right to have measles, and the like.  The first of these rights was once universally believed to be derived directly from the will of God; and this is still sometimes affirmed _in partibus infidelium_ outside the enlightened realms of Democracy; as the well known lines of Sir Abednego Bink, following:
RIGHTEOUSNESS, n.  A sturdy virtue that was once found among the Pantidoodles inhabiting the lower part of the peninsula of Oque.  Some feeble attempts were made by returned missionaries to introduce it into several European countries, but it appears to have been imperfectly expounded.  An example of this faulty exposition is found in the only extant sermon of the pious Bishop Rowley, a characteristic passage from which is here given:
RIME, n.  Agreeing sounds in the terminals of verse, mostly bad.  The verses themselves, as distinguished from prose, mostly dull.  Usually (and wickedly) spelled "rhyme."
RIMER, n.  A poet regarded with indifference or disesteem.
RIOT, n.  A popular entertainment given to the military by innocent bystanders.
RITE, n.  A religious or semi-religious ceremony fixed by law, precept or custom, with the essential oil of sincerity carefully squeezed out of it.
RITUALISM, n.  A Dutch Garden of God where He may walk in rectilinear freedom, keeping off the grass.
ROAD, n.  A strip of land along which one may pass from where it is too tiresome to be to where it is futile to go.
ROBBER, n.  A candid man of affairs.
ROMANCE, n.  Fiction that owes no allegiance to the God of Things as They Are.  In the novel the writer's thought is tethered to probability, as a domestic horse to the hitching-post, but in romance it ranges at will over the entire region of the imagination—free, lawless, immune to bit and rein.  Your novelist is a poor creature, as Carlyle might say—a mere reporter.  He may invent his characters and plot, but he must not imagine anything taking place that might not occur, albeit his entire narrative is candidly a lie.  Why he imposes this hard condition on himself, and "drags at each remove a lengthening chain" of his own forging he can explain in ten thick volumes without illuminating by so much as a candle's ray the black profound of his own ignorance of the matter.  There are great novels, for great writers have "laid waste their powers" to write them, but it remains true that far and away the most fascinating fiction that we have is "The Thousand and One Nights."
ROPE, n.  An obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they too are mortal.  It is put about the neck and remains in place one's whole life long.  It has been largely superseded by a more complex electrical device worn upon another part of the person; and this is rapidly giving place to an apparatus known as the preachment.
ROSTRUM, n.  In Latin, the beak of a bird or the prow of a ship.  In America, a place from which a candidate for office energetically expounds the wisdom, virtue and power of the rabble.
ROUNDHEAD, n.  A member of the Parliamentarian party in the English civil war—so called from his habit of wearing his hair short, whereas his enemy, the Cavalier, wore his long.  There were other points of difference between them, but the fashion in hair was the fundamental cause of quarrel.  The Cavaliers were royalists because the king, an indolent fellow, found it more convenient to let his hair grow than to wash his neck.  This the Roundheads, who were mostly barbers and soap-boilers, deemed an injury to trade, and the royal neck was therefore the object of their particular indignation. Descendants of the belligerents now wear their hair all alike, but the fires of animosity enkindled in that ancient strife smoulder to this day beneath the snows of British civility.
RUBBISH, n.  Worthless matter, such as the religions, philosophies, literatures, arts and sciences of the tribes infesting the regions lying due south from Boreaplas.
RUIN, v.  To destroy.  Specifically, to destroy a maid's belief in the virtue of maids.
RUM, n.  Generically, fiery liquors that produce madness in total abstainers.
RUMOR, n.  A favorite weapon of the assassins of character.
RUSSIAN, n.  A person with a Caucasian body and a Mongolian soul.  A Tartar Emetic.
SABBATH, n.  A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh.  Among the Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the Christian version:  "Remember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it wholly."  To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week, but the Early Fathers of the Church held other views.  So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is reverently recognized, as is manifest in the following deep-water version of the Fourth Commandment:
SACERDOTALIST, n.  One who holds the belief that a clergyman is a priest.  Denial of this momentous doctrine is the hardest challenge that is now flung into the teeth of the Episcopalian church by the Neo-Dictionarians.
SACRAMENT, n.  A solemn religious ceremony to which several degrees of authority and significance are attached.  Rome has seven sacraments, but the Protestant churches, being less prosperous, feel that they can afford only two, and these of inferior sanctity.  Some of the smaller sects have no sacraments at all—for which mean economy they will indubitable be damned.
SACRED, adj.  Dedicated to some religious purpose; having a divine character; inspiring solemn thoughts or emotions; as, the Dalai Lama of Thibet; the Moogum of M'bwango; the temple of Apes in Ceylon; the Cow in India; the Crocodile, the Cat and the Onion of ancient Egypt; the Mufti of Moosh; the hair of the dog that bit Noah, etc.
SANDLOTTER, n.  A vertebrate mammal holding the political views of Denis Kearney, a notorious demagogue of San Francisco, whose audiences gathered in the open spaces (sandlots) of the town.  True to the traditions of his species, this leader of the proletariat was finally bought off by his law-and-order enemies, living prosperously silent and dying impenitently rich.  But before his treason he imposed upon California a constitution that was a confection of sin in a diction of solecisms.  The similarity between the words "sandlotter" and "sansculotte" is problematically significant, but indubitably suggestive.
SAFETY-CLUTCH, n.  A mechanical device acting automatically to prevent the fall of an elevator, or cage, in case of an accident to the hoisting apparatus.
SAINT, n.  A dead sinner revised and edited.
SALACITY, n.  A certain literary quality frequently observed in popular novels, especially in those written by women and young girls, who give it another name and think that in introducing it they are occupying a neglected field of letters and reaping an overlooked harvest.  If they have the misfortune to live long enough they are tormented with a desire to burn their sheaves.
SALAMANDER, n.  Originally a reptile inhabiting fire; later, an anthropomorphous immortal, but still a pyrophile.  Salamanders are now believed to be extinct, the last one of which we have an account having been seen in Carcassonne by the Abbe Belloc, who exorcised it with a bucket of holy water.
SARCOPHAGUS, n.  Among the Greeks a coffin which being made of a certain kind of carnivorous stone, had the peculiar property of devouring the body placed in it.  The sarcophagus known to modern obsequiographers is commonly a product of the carpenter's art.
SATAN, n.  One of the Creator's lamentable mistakes, repented in sashcloth and axes.  Being instated as an archangel, Satan made himself multifariously objectionable and was finally expelled from Heaven.  Halfway in his descent he paused, bent his head in thought a moment and at last went back.  "There is one favor that I should like to ask," said he.
SATIETY, n.  The feeling that one has for the plate after he has eaten its contents, madam.
SATIRE, n.  An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the author's enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness.  In this country satire never had more than a sickly and uncertain existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we are dolefully deficient, the humor that we mistake for it, like all humor, being tolerant and sympathetic.  Moreover, although Americans are "endowed by their Creator" with abundant vice and folly, it is not generally known that these are reprehensible qualities, wherefore the satirist is popularly regarded as a soul-spirited knave, and his ever victim's outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent.
SATYR, n.  One of the few characters of the Grecian mythology accorded recognition in the Hebrew.  (Leviticus, xvii, 7.)  The satyr was at first a member of the dissolute community acknowledging a loose allegiance with Dionysius, but underwent many transformations and improvements.  Not infrequently he is confounded with the faun, a later and decenter creation of the Romans, who was less like a man and more like a goat.
SAUCE, n.  The one infallible sign of civilization and enlightenment. A people with no sauces has one thousand vices; a people with one sauce has only nine hundred and ninety-nine.  For every sauce invented and accepted a vice is renounced and forgiven.
SAW, n.  A trite popular saying, or proverb.  (Figurative and colloquial.)  So called because it makes its way into a wooden head. Following are examples of old saws fitted with new teeth.
SCARABAEUS, n.  The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians, allied to our familiar "tumble-bug."  It was supposed to symbolize immortality, the fact that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity.  Its habit of incubating its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it to the favor of the priesthood, and may some day assure it an equal reverence among ourselves.  True, the American beetle is an inferior beetle, but the American priest is an inferior priest.
SCARABEE, n.  The same as scarabaeus.
SCARIFICATION, n.  A form of penance practised by the mediaeval pious. The rite was performed, sometimes with a knife, sometimes with a hot iron, but always, says Arsenius Asceticus, acceptably if the penitent spared himself no pain nor harmless disfigurement.  Scarification, with other crude penances, has now been superseded by benefaction. The founding of a library or endowment of a university is said to yield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is conferred by the knife or iron, and is therefore a surer means of grace.  There are, however, two grave objections to it as a penitential method:  the good that it does and the taint of justice.
SCEPTER, n.  A king's staff of office, the sign and symbol of his authority.  It was originally a mace with which the sovereign admonished his jester and vetoed ministerial measures by breaking the bones of their proponents.
SCIMETAR, n.  A curved sword of exceeding keenness, in the conduct of which certain Orientals attain a surprising proficiency, as the incident here related will serve to show.  The account is translated from the Japanese by Shusi Itama, a famous writer of the thirteenth century.
SCRAP-BOOK, n.  A book that is commonly edited by a fool.  Many persons of some small distinction compile scrap-books containing whatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to collect.  One of these egotists was addressed in the lines following, by Agamemnon Melancthon Peters:
SCRIBBLER, n.  A professional writer whose views are antagonistic to one's own.
SCRIPTURES, n.  The sacred books of our holy religion, as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based.
SEAL, n.  A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their authenticity and authority.  Sometimes it is stamped upon wax, and attached to the paper, sometimes into the paper itself.  Sealing, in this sense, is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent.  In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a sacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now.  As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful.  Our word "sincere" is derived from _sine cero_, without wax, but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny.  Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis.  The initials L.S., commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean _locum sigillis_, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used —an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish.  The words _locum sigillis_ are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union.
SEINE, n.  A kind of net for effecting an involuntary change of environment.  For fish it is made strong and coarse, but women are more easily taken with a singularly delicate fabric weighted with small, cut stones.
SELF-ESTEEM, n.  An erroneous appraisement.
SELF-EVIDENT, adj.  Evident to one's self and to nobody else.
SELFISH, adj.  Devoid of consideration for the selfishness of others.
SENATE, n.  A body of elderly gentlemen charged with high duties and misdemeanors.
SERIAL, n.  A literary work, usually a story that is not true, creeping through several issues of a newspaper or magazine. Frequently appended to each installment is a "synposis of preceding chapters" for those who have not read them, but a direr need is a synposis of succeeding chapters for those who do not intend to read _them_.  A synposis of the entire work would be still better.
SEVERALTY, n.  Separateness, as, lands in severalty, i.e., lands held individually, not in joint ownership.  Certain tribes of Indians are believed now to be sufficiently civilized to have in severalty the lands that they have hitherto held as tribal organizations, and could not sell to the Whites for waxen beads and potato whiskey.
SHERIFF, n.  In America the chief executive office of a country, whose most characteristic duties, in some of the Western and Southern States, are the catching and hanging of rogues.
SIREN, n.  One of several musical prodigies famous for a vain attempt to dissuade Odysseus from a life on the ocean wave.  Figuratively, any lady of splendid promise, dissembled purpose and disappointing performance.
SLANG, n.  The grunt of the human hog (_Pignoramus intolerabilis_) with an audible memory.  The speech of one who utters with his tongue what he thinks with his ear, and feels the pride of a creator in accomplishing the feat of a parrot.  A means (under Providence) of setting up as a wit without a capital of sense.
SMITHAREEN, n.  A fragment, a decomponent part, a remain.  The word is used variously, but in the following verse on a noted female reformer who opposed bicycle-riding by women because it "led them to the devil" it is seen at its best:
SOPHISTRY, n.  The controversial method of an opponent, distinguished from one's own by superior insincerity and fooling.  This method is that of the later Sophists, a Grecian sect of philosophers who began by teaching wisdom, prudence, science, art and, in brief, whatever men ought to know, but lost themselves in a maze of quibbles and a fog of words.
SORCERY, n.  The ancient prototype and forerunner of political influence.  It was, however, deemed less respectable and sometimes was punished by torture and death.  Augustine Nicholas relates that a poor peasant who had been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to compel a confession.  After enduring a few gentle agonies the suffering simpleton admitted his guilt, but naively asked his tormentors if it were not possible to be a sorcerer without knowing it.
SOUL, n.  A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave disputation.  Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of existence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers.  Plato himself was a philosopher.  The souls that had least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots.  Dionysius I, who had threatened to decapitate the broad-browed philosopher, was a usurper and a despot.  Plato, doubtless, was not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies; certainly he was not the last.
SPOOKER, n.  A writer whose imagination concerns itself with supernatural phenomena, especially in the doings of spooks.  One of the most illustrious spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells, who introduces a well-credentialed reader to as respectable and mannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet.  To the terror that invests the chairman of a district school board, the Howells ghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another township.
STORY, n.  A narrative, commonly untrue.  The truth of the stories here following has, however, not been successfully impeached.
SUCCESS, n.  The one unpardonable sin against one's fellows.  In literature, and particularly in poetry, the elements of success are exceedingly simple, and are admirably set forth in the following lines by the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape, entitled, for some mysterious reason, "John A. Joyce."
SUFFRAGE, n.  Expression of opinion by means of a ballot.  The right of suffrage (which is held to be both a privilege and a duty) means, as commonly interpreted, the right to vote for the man of another man's choice, and is highly prized.  Refusal to do so has the bad name of "incivism."  The incivilian, however, cannot be properly arraigned for his crime, for there is no legitimate accuser.  If the accuser is himself guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion; if not, he profits by the crime, for A's abstention from voting gives greater weight to the vote of B.  By female suffrage is meant the right of a woman to vote as some man tells her to.  It is based on female responsibility, which is somewhat limited.  The woman most eager to jump out of her petticoat to assert her rights is first to jump back into it when threatened with a switching for misusing them.
SYCOPHANT, n.  One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he may not be commanded to turn and be kicked.  He is sometimes an editor.
SYLLOGISM, n.  A logical formula consisting of a major and a minor assumption and an inconsequent.  (See LOGIC.)
SYLPH, n.  An immaterial but visible being that inhabited the air when the air was an element and before it was fatally polluted with factory smoke, sewer gas and similar products of civilization.  Sylphs were allied to gnomes, nymphs and salamanders, which dwelt, respectively, in earth, water and fire, all now insalubrious.  Sylphs, like fowls of the air, were male and female, to no purpose, apparently, for if they had progeny they must have nested in accessible places, none of the chicks having ever been seen.
SYMBOL, n.  Something that is supposed to typify or stand for something else.  Many symbols are mere "survivals"—things which having no longer any utility continue to exist because we have inherited the tendency to make them; as funereal urns carved on memorial monuments.  They were once real urns holding the ashes of the dead.  We cannot stop making them, but we can give them a name that conceals our helplessness.
SYMBOLIC, adj.  Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation of symbols.
T, the twentieth letter of the English alphabet, was by the Greeks absurdly called _tau_.  In the alphabet whence ours comes it had the form of the rude corkscrew of the period, and when it stood alone (which was more than the Phoenicians could always do) signified _Tallegal_, translated by the learned Dr. Brownrigg, "tanglefoot."
TAIL, n.  The part of an animal's spine that has transcended its natural limitations to set up an independent existence in a world of its own.  Excepting in its foetal state, Man is without a tail, a privation of which he attests an hereditary and uneasy consciousness by the coat-skirt of the male and the train of the female, and by a marked tendency to ornament that part of his attire where the tail should be, and indubitably once was.  This tendency is most observable in the female of the species, in whom the ancestral sense is strong and persistent.  The tailed men described by Lord Monboddo are now generally regarded as a product of an imagination unusually susceptible to influences generated in the golden age of our pithecan past.
TAKE, v.t.  To acquire, frequently by force but preferably by stealth.
TALK, v.t.  To commit an indiscretion without temptation, from an impulse without purpose.
TARIFF, n.  A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.
TECHNICALITY, n.  In an English court a man named Home was tried for slander in having accused his neighbor of murder.  His exact words were:  "Sir Thomas Holt hath taken a cleaver and stricken his cook upon the head, so that one side of the head fell upon one shoulder and the other side upon the other shoulder."  The defendant was acquitted by instruction of the court, the learned judges holding that the words did not charge murder, for they did not affirm the death of the cook, that being only an inference.
TEDIUM, n.  Ennui, the state or condition of one that is bored.  Many fanciful derivations of the word have been affirmed, but so high an authority as Father Jape says that it comes from a very obvious source—the first words of the ancient Latin hymn _Te Deum Laudamus_.  In this apparently natural derivation there is something that saddens.
TEETOTALER, n.  One who abstains from strong drink, sometimes totally, sometimes tolerably totally.
TELEPHONE, n.  An invention of the devil which abrogates some of the advantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.
TELESCOPE, n.  A device having a relation to the eye similar to that of the telephone to the ear, enabling distant objects to plague us with a multitude of needless details.  Luckily it is unprovided with a bell summoning us to the sacrifice.
TENACITY, n.  A certain quality of the human hand in its relation to the coin of the realm.  It attains its highest development in the hand of authority and is considered a serviceable equipment for a career in politics.  The following illustrative lines were written of a Californian gentleman in high political preferment, who has passed to his accounting:
THEOSOPHY, n.  An ancient faith having all the certitude of religion and all the mystery of science.  The modern Theosophist holds, with the Buddhists, that we live an incalculable number of times on this earth, in as many several bodies, because one life is not long enough for our complete spiritual development; that is, a single lifetime does not suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to wish to become.  To be absolutely wise and good—that is perfection; and the Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that everything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection. Less competent observers are disposed to except cats, which seem neither wiser nor better than they were last year.  The greatest and fattest of recent Theosophists was the late Madame Blavatsky, who had no cat.
TIGHTS, n.  An habiliment of the stage designed to reinforce the general acclamation of the press agent with a particular publicity. Public attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to Miss Lillian Russell's refusal to wear it, and many were the conjectures as to her motive, the guess of Miss Pauline Hall showing a high order of ingenuity and sustained reflection.  It was Miss Hall's belief that nature had not endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs.  This theory was impossible of acceptance by the male understanding, but the conception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as to rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation! It is strange that in all the controversy regarding Miss Russell's aversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what was known among the ancients as "modesty."  The nature of that sentiment is now imperfectly understood, and possibly incapable of exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us.  The study of lost arts has, however, been recently revived and some of the arts themselves recovered.  This is an epoch of _renaissances_, and there is ground for hope that the primitive "blush" may be dragged from its hiding-place amongst the tombs of antiquity and hissed on to the stage.
TOMB, n.  The House of Indifference.  Tombs are now by common consent invested with a certain sanctity, but when they have been long tenanted it is considered no sin to break them open and rifle them, the famous Egyptologist, Dr. Huggyns, explaining that a tomb may be innocently "glened" as soon as its occupant is done "smellynge," the soul being then all exhaled.  This reasonable view is now generally accepted by archaeologists, whereby the noble science of Curiosity has been greatly dignified.
TOPE, v.  To tipple, booze, swill, soak, guzzle, lush, bib, or swig. In the individual, toping is regarded with disesteem, but toping nations are in the forefront of civilization and power.  When pitted against the hard-drinking Christians the abstemious Mahometans go down like grass before the scythe.  In India one hundred thousand beef-eating and brandy-and-soda guzzling Britons hold in subjection two hundred and fifty million vegetarian abstainers of the same Aryan race. With what an easy grace the whisky-loving American pushed the temperate Spaniard out of his possessions!  From the time when the Berserkers ravaged all the coasts of western Europe and lay drunk in every conquered port it has been the same way:  everywhere the nations that drink too much are observed to fight rather well and not too righteously.  Wherefore the estimable old ladies who abolished the canteen from the American army may justly boast of having materially augmented the nation's military power.
TORTOISE, n.  A creature thoughtfully created to supply occasion for the following lines by the illustrious Ambat Delaso:
TREE, n.  A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal apparatus, though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear only a negligible fruit, or none at all.  When naturally fruited, the tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor in public morals.  In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit (white and black respectively) though not eaten, is agreeable to the public taste and, though not exported, profitable to the general welfare.  That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no discovery of Judge Lynch (who, indeed, conceded it no primacy over the lamp-post and the bridge-girder) is made plain by the following passage from Morryster, who antedated him by two centuries:
TRIAL, n.  A formal inquiry designed to prove and put upon record the blameless characters of judges, advocates and jurors.  In order to effect this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person of one who is called the defendant, the prisoner, or the accused.  If the contrast is made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo such an affliction as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable sense of their immunity, added to that of their worth.  In our day the accused is usually a human being, or a socialist, but in mediaeval times, animals, fishes, reptiles and insects were brought to trial.  A beast that had taken human life, or practiced sorcery, was duly arrested, tried and, if condemned, put to death by the public executioner.  Insects ravaging grain fields, orchards or vineyards were cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal, and after testimony, argument and condemnation, if they continued _in contumaciam_ the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court, where they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized.  In a street of Toledo, some pigs that had wickedly run between the viceroy's legs, upsetting him, were arrested on a warrant, tried and punished.  In Naples and ass was condemned to be burned at the stake, but the sentence appears not to have been executed.  D'Addosio relates from the court records many trials of pigs, bulls, horses, cocks, dogs, goats, etc., greatly, it is believed, to the betterment of their conduct and morals.  In 1451 a suit was brought against the leeches infesting some ponds about Berne, and the Bishop of Lausanne, instructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University, directed that some of "the aquatic worms" be brought before the local magistracy.  This was done and the leeches, both present and absent, were ordered to leave the places that they had infested within three days on pain of incurring "the malediction of God."  In the voluminous records of this _cause celebre_ nothing is found to show whether the offenders braved the punishment, or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable jurisdiction.
TRICHINOSIS, n.  The pig's reply to proponents of porcophagy.
TRINITY, n.  In the multiplex theism of certain Christian churches, three entirely distinct deities consistent with only one.  Subordinate deities of the polytheistic faith, such as devils and angels, are not dowered with the power of combination, and must urge individually their claims to adoration and propitiation.  The Trinity is one of the most sublime mysteries of our holy religion.  In rejecting it because it is incomprehensible, Unitarians betray their inadequate sense of theological fundamentals.  In religion we believe only what we do not understand, except in the instance of an intelligible doctrine that contradicts an incomprehensible one.  In that case we believe the former as a part of the latter.
TROGLODYTE, n.  Specifically, a cave-dweller of the paleolithic period, after the Tree and before the Flat.  A famous community of troglodytes dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam.  The colony consisted of "every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented"—in brief, all the Socialists of Judah.
TRUCE, n.  Friendship.
TRUTH, n.  An ingenious compound of desirability and appearance. Discovery of truth is the sole purpose of philosophy, which is the most ancient occupation of the human mind and has a fair prospect of existing with increasing activity to the end of time.
TRUTHFUL, adj.  Dumb and illiterate.
TRUST, n.  In American politics, a large corporation composed in greater part of thrifty working men, widows of small means, orphans in the care of guardians and the courts, with many similar malefactors and public enemies.
TURKEY, n.  A large bird whose flesh when eaten on certain religious anniversaries has the peculiar property of attesting piety and gratitude.  Incidentally, it is pretty good eating.
TWICE, adv.  Once too often.
TYPE, n.  Pestilent bits of metal suspected of destroying civilization and enlightenment, despite their obvious agency in this incomparable dictionary.
UBIQUITY, n.  The gift or power of being in all places at one time, but not in all places at all times, which is omnipresence, an attribute of God and the luminiferous ether only.  This important distinction between ubiquity and omnipresence was not clear to the mediaeval Church and there was much bloodshed about it.  Certain Lutherans, who affirmed the presence everywhere of Christ's body were known as Ubiquitarians.  For this error they were doubtless damned, for Christ's body is present only in the eucharist, though that sacrament may be performed in more than one place simultaneously.  In recent times ubiquity has not always been understood—not even by Sir Boyle Roche, for example, who held that a man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a bird.
UGLINESS, n.  A gift of the gods to certain women, entailing virtue without humility.
ULTIMATUM, n.  In diplomacy, a last demand before resorting to concessions.
UN-AMERICAN, adj.  Wicked, intolerable, heathenish.
UNCTION, n.  An oiling, or greasing.  The rite of extreme unction consists in touching with oil consecrated by a bishop several parts of the body of one engaged in dying.  Marbury relates that after the rite had been administered to a certain wicked English nobleman it was discovered that the oil had not been properly consecrated and no other could be obtained.  When informed of this the sick man said in anger: "Then I'll be damned if I die!"
UNDERSTANDING, n.  A cerebral secretion that enables one having it to know a house from a horse by the roof on the house.  Its nature and laws have been exhaustively expounded by Locke, who rode a house, and Kant, who lived in a horse.
UNITARIAN, n.  One who denies the divinity of a Trinitarian.
UNIVERSALIST, n.  One who forgoes the advantage of a Hell for persons of another faith.
URBANITY, n.  The kind of civility that urban observers ascribe to dwellers in all cities but New York.  Its commonest expression is heard in the words, "I beg your pardon," and it is not consistent with disregard of the rights of others.
USAGE, n.  The First Person of the literary Trinity, the Second and Third being Custom and Conventionality.  Imbued with a decent reverence for this Holy Triad an industrious writer may hope to produce books that will live as long as the fashion.
UXORIOUSNESS, n.  A perverted affection that has strayed to one's own wife.

VOTE, n.  The instrument and symbol of a freeman's power to make a fool of himself and a wreck of his country.
WALL STREET, n.  A symbol for sin for every devil to rebuke.  That Wall Street is a den of thieves is a belief that serves every unsuccessful thief in place of a hope in Heaven.  Even the great and good Andrew Carnegie has made his profession of faith in the matter.
WAR, n.  A by-product of the arts of peace.  The most menacing political condition is a period of international amity.  The student of history who has not been taught to expect the unexpected may justly boast himself inaccessible to the light.  "In time of peace prepare for war" has a deeper meaning than is commonly discerned; it means, not merely that all things earthly have an end—that change is the one immutable and eternal law—but that the soil of peace is thickly sown with the seeds of war and singularly suited to their germination and growth.  It was when Kubla Khan had decreed his "stately pleasure dome"—when, that is to say, there were peace and fat feasting in Xanadu—that he
WASHINGTONIAN, n.  A Potomac tribesman who exchanged the privilege of governing himself for the advantage of good government.  In justice to him it should be said that he did not want to.
WEAKNESSES, n.pl.  Certain primal powers of Tyrant Woman wherewith she holds dominion over the male of her species, binding him to the service of her will and paralyzing his rebellious energies.
WEATHER, n.  The climate of the hour.  A permanent topic of conversation among persons whom it does not interest, but who have inherited the tendency to chatter about it from naked arboreal ancestors whom it keenly concerned.  The setting up official weather bureaus and their maintenance in mendacity prove that even governments are accessible to suasion by the rude forefathers of the jungle.
WEDDING, n.  A ceremony at which two persons undertake to become one, one undertakes to become nothing, and nothing undertakes to become supportable.
WEREWOLF, n.  A wolf that was once, or is sometimes, a man.  All werewolves are of evil disposition, having assumed a bestial form to gratify a beastial appetite, but some, transformed by sorcery, are as humane and is consistent with an acquired taste for human flesh.
WHANGDEPOOTENAWAH, n.  In the Ojibwa tongue, disaster; an unexpected affliction that strikes hard.
WHEAT, n.  A cereal from which a tolerably good whisky can with some difficulty be made, and which is used also for bread.  The French are said to eat more bread _per capita_ of population than any other people, which is natural, for only they know how to make the stuff palatable.
WHITE, adj. and n.  Black.
WIDOW, n.  A pathetic figure that the Christian world has agreed to take humorously, although Christ's tenderness towards widows was one of the most marked features of his character.
WINE, n.  Fermented grape-juice known to the Women's Christian Union as "liquor," sometimes as "rum."  Wine, madam, is God's next best gift to man.

WITTICISM, n.  A sharp and clever remark, usually quoted, and seldom noted; what the Philistine is pleased to call a "joke."
WORSHIP, n.  Homo Creator's testimony to the sound construction and fine finish of Deus Creatus.  A popular form of abjection, having an element of pride.
WRATH, n.  Anger of a superior quality and degree, appropriate to exalted characters and momentous occasions; as, "the wrath of God," "the day of wrath," etc.  Amongst the ancients the wrath of kings was deemed sacred, for it could usually command the agency of some god for its fit manifestation, as could also that of a priest.  The Greeks before Troy were so harried by Apollo that they jumped out of the frying-pan of the wrath of Cryses into the fire of the wrath of Achilles, though Agamemnon, the sole offender, was neither fried nor roasted.  A similar noted immunity was that of David when he incurred the wrath of Yahveh by numbering his people, seventy thousand of whom paid the penalty with their lives.  God is now Love, and a director of the census performs his work without apprehension of disaster.
YANKEE, n.  In Europe, an American.  In the Northern States of our Union, a New Englander.  In the Southern States the word is unknown. (See DAMNYANK.)
YEAR, n.  A period of three hundred and sixty-five disappointments.
YESTERDAY, n.  The infancy of youth, the youth of manhood, the entire past of age.
YOKE, n.  An implement, madam, to whose Latin name, _jugum_, we owe one of the most illuminating words in our language—a word that defines the matrimonial situation with precision, point and poignancy. A thousand apologies for withholding it.
YOUTH, n.  The Period of Possibility, when Archimedes finds a fulcrum, Cassandra has a following and seven cities compete for the honor of endowing a living Homer.
ZANY, n.  A popular character in old Italian plays, who imitated with ludicrous incompetence the _buffone_, or clown, and was therefore the ape of an ape; for the clown himself imitated the serious characters of the play.  The zany was progenitor to the specialist in humor, as we to-day have the unhappiness to know him.  In the zany we see an example of creation; in the humorist, of transmission.  Another excellent specimen of the modern zany is the curate, who apes the rector, who apes the bishop, who apes the archbishop, who apes the devil.
ZANZIBARI, n.  An inhabitant of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, off the eastern coast of Africa.  The Zanzibaris, a warlike people, are best known in this country through a threatening diplomatic incident that occurred a few years ago.  The American consul at the capital occupied a dwelling that faced the sea, with a sandy beach between.  Greatly to the scandal of this official's family, and against repeated remonstrances of the official himself, the people of the city persisted in using the beach for bathing.  One day a woman came down to the edge of the water and was stooping to remove her attire (a pair of sandals) when the consul, incensed beyond restraint, fired a charge of bird-shot into the most conspicuous part of her person. Unfortunately for the existing _entente cordiale_ between two great nations, she was the Sultana.
ZEAL, n.  A certain nervous disorder afflicting the young and inexperienced.  A passion that goeth before a sprawl.
ZENITH, n.  The point in the heavens directly overhead to a man standing or a growing cabbage.  A man in bed or a cabbage in the pot is not considered as having a zenith, though from this view of the matter there was once a considerably dissent among the learned, some holding that the posture of the body was immaterial.  These were called Horizontalists, their opponents, Verticalists.  The Horizontalist heresy was finally extinguished by Xanobus, the philosopher-king of Abara, a zealous Verticalist.  Entering an assembly of philosophers who were debating the matter, he cast a severed human head at the feet of his opponents and asked them to determine its zenith, explaining that its body was hanging by the heels outside.  Observing that it was the head of their leader, the Horizontalists hastened to profess themselves converted to whatever opinion the Crown might be pleased to hold, and Horizontalism took its place among _fides defuncti_.
ZEUS, n.  The chief of Grecian gods, adored by the Romans as Jupiter and by the modern Americans as God, Gold, Mob and Dog.  Some explorers who have touched upon the shores of America, and one who professes to have penetrated a considerable distance to the interior, have thought that these four names stand for as many distinct deities, but in his monumental work on Surviving Faiths, Frumpp insists that the natives are monotheists, each having no other god than himself, whom he worships under many sacred names.
ZIGZAG, v.t.  To move forward uncertainly, from side to side, as one carrying the white man's burden.  (From _zed_, _z_, and _jag_, an Icelandic word of unknown meaning.)
ZOOLOGY, n.  The science and history of the animal kingdom, including its king, the House Fly (_Musca maledicta_).  The father of Zoology was Aristotle, as is universally conceded, but the name of its mother has not come down to us.  Two of the science's most illustrious expounders were Buffon and Oliver Goldsmith, from both of whom we learn (_L'Histoire generale des animaux_ and _A History of Animated Nature_) that the domestic cow sheds its horn every two years.
